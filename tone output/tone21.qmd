# Welcome to Teaching Online Effectively21 (TOnE21)! {.unnumbered}


### Course Description

For the next eight weeks, we'll dive into some key ideas to help you design your course with flexibility in mind. Whether you need to put your full course online this summer/fall, or you want to include more online elements in your campus course, we hope that this mini-course provides the information and resources you need.

Another key focus of our time together is to build a *Community of Inquiry* - a forum where we can share resources, experiences, and ideas about course design.

Our focus this time around will be on giving you some tools and competencies you can use to design and run your courses with asynchronicity in mind. We know that Zoom is uniquely fatiguing for both instructors and learners, so this course will model how to take the next step from a 'one-to-many' transmission model, to a 'many-to-many' transformational model of teaching and learning.

We have spread out the interactions in the course over eight weeks instead of four to provide you with a little more thinking space and time to consider what we offer. We will also reduce the emphasis on 'content' distribution in our synchronous meetings and instead share that asynchronously via our course blog at [multi-access.twu.ca/tone21](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone21){target="_blank"}.

# Welcome to TOnE21! {.unnumbered}

We trust you are finding balance in your work as we are in the thick of Spring 2021 semester. We know that this year has been challenging for many people and for many different reasons, not least of which is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impacts on higher ed.

The intent of this iteration of the TOnE course is to equip you to prepare for Summer and Fall '21, as it appears that 'normal' has changed in higher ed.

Many learned last year that trying to replicate a face-to-face classroom experience in an online environment is challenging. Zoom is not a classroom. Timezones are a thing. Some people (instructors and learners alike) have inadequate internet bandwidth to support video-conferencing.

So for this iteration of the TOnE course, we are going to focus on a primarily asynchronous, low-bandwidth mode of communication supplemented with more casual and unstructured synchronous meetings.

Below this post, you will see what is called a 'feed' which is essentially a subscription to a blog. Each time I publish a post, that post will show up at the top of the feed. Each post will outline some new content and resources for that topic. You will also notice posts from the Library and other faculty at TWU.

Although I am using a blog to keep you all up-to-date, you can do the same thing with a list of emails.

!!!! If you have your own blog and would like to respond to the reflection prompts for this week on your own blog, send me the URL and I will create another feed of participant posts.


### Interacting in TOnE21

We have set up multiple channels for communication during TOnE21, some of which we hope will persist after the course is officially over.


#### Moodle {.unnumbered}

You may be most familiar with the Moodle discussion forum tool for interactions in an online course, or maybe it is new for you. Either way, we have created a forum for each of the four units of the course as well as a general forum for Q&A. [These forums are available on the 'Interactions' tab in the Moodle site](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=17949&section=2){target="_blank"}, and you are encouraged to use those forums to respond to the suggested learning activities in each post. The 'Enrol key' is `tone21`.

During each 2-week unit, and spread out during the unit, course contributors (listed on the Overview page), will publish a blog post about one topic in the unit we are engaging with. Each unit will contain 4-5 posts, each from a different author. [You will be able to access those posts in Moodle, on the 'Interactions' tab](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=17949&section=2){target="_blank"} under the heading 'Course Feed'.

Also within Moodle, we have added an 'External tool' connection to a MS OneNote binder. This is available for you to organize learning pods and for your learning pod to use as a collaborative workspace. We are very interested in how you use this space.


#### The course website {.unnumbered}

This course is published at [multi-access.tuw.ca/tone/tone21](https://multi-access.tuw.ca/tone/tone21){target="_blank"}, and the content you see in Moodle is an embedded view of the content on the course website. [You can find the course blog under the menu item 'Course Updates'](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21/blog){target="_blank"}.

If you would like to be updated on posts as they are published, you may want to use a feed reader like [Feedly](https://feedly.com){target="_blank"} or [Inoreader](https://inoreader.com){target="_blank"} to subscribe to the course feed, which is `https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21.rss`.


#### The connected network of your sites {.unnumbered}

The web is profoundly powerful for a number of reasons, including the humble hyperlink, and a protocol known by its acronym, RSS. TWU hosts a WordPress installation for anyone in the community who would like to register for a site of their own. You may be interested in using this site at [create.twu.ca](https://create.twu.ca){target="_blank"} to start a blog to record your responses and reflections related to TOnE21. If you choose to do this, please let us know, and we will add the feed from your site (it's alreay set up by default) to a feed of participant responses accessible in Moodle or in a feed reader.

Choosing this option will allow you to build a rich network of connected blogs that reference each other and can then grow and develop beyond the course. Please email elearning at twu dot ca if you need assistance.


#### Hypothes.is {.unnumbered}

As you may have heard, TWU is part of a pilot project using the tool [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is){target="_blank"}, a tool used to annotate documents and publications available on the web. The pilot includes access to hypothes.is directly within Moodle and connected to the course list and gradebook. We will publish a post with instructions for how to use hypothes.is.


#### Synchronous meetings {.unnumbered}

Every other Friday, beginning February 12, at 11:00 AM Pacific time, we will meet in Zoom (link is published in Moodle), for a time of collegial reflection and support. This will not be used as a time to broadcast content, but a time to engage in conversation about what we are learning. We hope you will join us.

Also, on the opposite Fridays at 11:00 AM at the same Zoom link, we meet for the TOnE Swap Meets for a more informal time of sharing strategies, tools, and resources in a collegial and supportive environment.


#### Learning Pods {.unnumbered}

We will facilitate the formation of small learning pods of 2-4 people who will meet on their own schedule and time to discuss the course and provide support for each other.


### An invitation...

You are invited, but certainly not obligated, to participate in the manner that makes sense for you, your workload, and your personal context. If you try to engage fully with all of the activities and channels available to you, you will likely run out of time, so please be conscious of your needs and bandwidth.

We look forward to the next several weeks!


# Course Modalities

We begin this unit by investigating some terminology you may have heard when people start talking about online learning:

'Hybrid', 'blended', 'hyflex', 'blended-sync', 'multi-access', 'flipped', 'bi-synchronous', 'synchro-modal'...oh my!

Don't worry if you are having difficulty making sense of any of the terms used to describe the various ways instructors or programs choose to deliver their courses. There has been a lack of consensus, or even consistency, on terminology for a long time. In the old days when instructors first started tinkering with using the web to deliver courses, there were two options, 'face-to-face' (lectures) and 'online' (text-based). Face-to-face was what we all know and understand and was delivered synchronously. Online, however, was very slow, relying on IRC and similar 'chat' services or email listservs, and was therefore, asynchronous. This asynchronicity likely led traditional instructors to view online learning with some suspicion due to the resemblance to 'correspondence education' where course materials were delivered back and forth between instructors and learners via the post office, often with weeks of delay.

Another source of confusion in the area is the conflation of pedagogy with modality. Pedagogy refers to the ways that learning is structured, the activities that learners engage in, and the assessment strategies used to infer a grade. Modality usually refers to the time and the place that those interactions occur. So the pedagogical strategy of having learners debate a topic can occur in any modality (synchronous/co-located, synchronous/remote, asynchronous/co-located or asynchronous/remote). It is important to remember that teaching and learning in a particular modality (online or face-to-face) does not necessarily determine a particular pedagogy.

Irvine (2020) argues that the pedagogy employed in a small face-to-face class can be either dynamic, interactive, and highly engaging, or it can be static, one-way transmission of factoids. Similarly online; if the pedagogical orientation prioritizes one-way transmission of content, chances are high that learners will have more difficulty engaging than if it is dynamic and interactive.

When thinking about pedagogy in different modalities, differences become apparent quite quickly. Going back to the example of a debate, we are all most likely familiar with in-person debates with oral arguments for and against a proposition, followed by rebuttals and so on. This often happens over the course of a couple of hours as the debaters present their prepared arguments and statements. While this model can make for compelling viewing in-person, it is completely ephemeral outside sophisticated recording equipment, and once it is recorded, the files (or physical tapes) involved (audio and video) are very large and cumbersome. On the other hand, it is relatively easy for a moderator to explain the rules of the debate to the debaters and the audience, and also to respond to questions in the moment to clarify any concerns.

Moving that same activity to an asynchronous, text-based environment has implications for how the activity unfolds. The content preparation remains the same in that both parties prepare their arguments ahead of time. However, the logistics of the activity change and require everything to be planned and written down ahead of time. The presentation of arguments also takes much longer as there is always a delay between sending and receiving a message.

One way to think about the differences in modalities is to consider who is left out in different modalities. For example, in a face-to-face environment, those learners who are quieter and less likely to speak are often excluded from the class conversations because they need time to process information before formulating a response. This represents a significant loss of valuable input in the discourse and also missed learning opportunities as these learners have less opportunity to have their ideas refined and misconceptions corrected. Conversely, in remote modalities, those whose internet bandwidth is limited will experience the same type of exclusion whether they have something to contribute or not. At the same time, those quieter learners have the opportunity to pause and reflect on others' contributions before drafting a response, then consider their words, revise, and finally contribute to the commons. This opportunity to time-delay responses often leads to a much richer and deeper discourse with the added benefit that anyone can revisit the record at any time.

TWU, in looking forward to emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, is recommending a specific combination of modalities that most closely match definitions of both 'hybrid' and 'blended' in the research. By using a combination of modalities where 50% of course 'contact time' occurs face-to-face and the remaining 50% is asynchronous, TWU can maximize the use of campus space, accommodate more learners. This suggestion brings with it implications for how instructors think about planning for courses.

The place to begin is undoubtedly representative of a significant lift in terms of workload, but the short-term cost will lead to many long-term benefits, regardless of the modality. We recommend that your starting place should be to prepare your entire course so that it could be delivered asynchronously, likely in a primarily text format. For many, this may mean editing and revising transcripts from recorded Zoom sessions from 2020, or it may mean exporting your slide decks to an outline in a word processor and then filling in details with commentary like the posts in TOnE21.

[ui-accordion independent=true open=none]
[ui-accordion-item title="An aside about slide decks..."]

Whether you use PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, or another slide generating tool, your slide decks are less helpful than you realize. Most often, slide decks must be downloaded from the web, opened in another program, and then navigated through one slide at a time. This creates unnecessary barriers to interacting with your content, limiting accessiblity for those who use screenreaders. It is much easier for learners to navigate through a well-structured webpage with heading levels replacing bullets on a slide.

In fact, Edward Tufte (2006) argues that the overuse of Powerpoint led to the deaths of the space shuttle Columbia's crew and cites the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report:

As information gets passed up an organization hierarchy, from people who do analysis to mid-level managers to high-level leadership, *key explanations and supporting information are filtered out*. In this context, it is easy to understand how a senior manager might read this PowerPoint slide and not realize that it addresses a life-threatening situation.

At many points during its investigation, the Board was surprised to receive similar presentation slides from NASA officials in place of technical reports. The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA." (emphasis added)

Ultimately, slide decks are designed to support live verbal presentations, not web-based reading. TWU GLOBAL Online instructional designers try to avoid slide decks whenever possible.

Now that we have clarified some of the language associated with online learning, and have a better understanding of the modalities associated with it, we now shift our attention to course structure. Designing a course in an online environment requires a shift in traditional "classroom" thinking. In an online learning environment, the goal is to create a positive, learner-centered experience. This requires careful consideration of how you are going to "structure" the design of your course.

One approach that can help with the development of your course is called the Flipped Classroom Approach outlined below.


## The Flipped Classroom Approach

The Flipped Classroom involves a "flip" or a change in learning culture. In the traditional teacher-centered approach, the teacher is the main source of information. By contrast, the Flipped Learning model purposefully shifts instruction to a student-centered approach. Core concepts are first encountered independently, while class time focuses on higher level cognitive activities and clarifying misconceptions.

[embedly url="https://twitter.com/belehaa/status/1354861842619891716?s=20"]

In an online environment, students study material asynchronously, and then apply these concepts through problem-solving and group activities during online workshops.

The "flipped" approach therefore encourages inquiry-based and cooperative learning, while simultaneously allowing students to explore concepts in greater depth. From the instructor's perspective, this approach can provide opportunities to address students' misconceptions and act as an immediate feedback tool.

## Developing Asynchronous Material

In an online flipped classroom, the majority of course content is available to students *before* the synchronous class time. Remote learning has altered the traditional classroom dynamic and impacted how we teach. As many students are already studying material asynchronously, we have the opportunity utilize the flipped classroom approach.

To begin, the focus should be on intentional content. Consider how you want your course content to "look" in this medium. What information do students need to learn before class in order to actively participate in group activities later? Scaffolding is common, particularly if there is a sizable amount of content. Using a combination of text and mini-lectures is another method of breaking up content into smaller chunks that learners can readily grasp. In the "flipped" approach, students are responsible for their own learning. Revising the pedagogy to fit the online modality **also means that students have flexibility and autonomy regarding how much time they devote to the instructor's asynchronous content.** Therefore, a combination of scaffolding and **purposively segmented** text and video recordings can encourage continuous study of material.

You might also consider using an inductive reasoning approach. Present scenarios, key words, or examples of the concept first, and allow students to make generalizations and inferences. One benefit of inductive learning is that it promotes analytical thinking, as students have to determine which information is and is not relevant.


### Challenges

One of the primary challenges associated with developing resources for the flipped classroom is that it requires significant preparation and can be time-consuming.

Utilizing material already available on YouTube and using Open Educational Resources can mitigate prep time. Resources from the Khan Academy, TED Talks (see the "Flip this Lesson" feature from TED-Ed), and using written prompts where students can "pause" to reflect on their learning will help students grasp important material. As students will be studying this material independently, the key is finding and creating content that has a stepwise progression.

## Developing Workshop Activities

John Biggs (2012) discusses the challenges associated with aligning teaching methods with cognitive objectives. He states that

tertiary objectives require students to use knowledge, [however] much tertiary teaching is not about using knowledge but telling students about using knowledge. Such declarative knowledge…does not necessarily imply that it can be used functionally (p. 48).

Class time in the "flipped" approach encourages student accountability and enhances self-efficacy. It provides a "training area" of sorts, where students can practice and apply concepts, make mistakes, and ask questions.

In an online format, repurposing class time into workshops can create rich learning opportunities. Workshops can involve interaction through learning pods (assessment "of" and "as" learning), collaboration through whiteboards, and larger synchronous group discussions. Using the Jigsaw Method (where each student is assigned a topic to "teach" their peers), [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/){target="_blank"} or [Nearpod](https://nearpod.com/international?utm_expid=.ZVArKVVVQnSoco-KQvCRUw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F){target="_blank"} (polling and collaborative boards), or [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/){target="_blank"} (gamified quizzes) can act as informal "checks" on whether students have read the material.

Since these workshops rely heavily on student participation, you are encouraged to develop activities which allow learners to draw from authentic experience. In this manner, information becomes more personalized, meaningful, and more likely content that students will remember.

In the previous section, we spent some time considering how our course would be structured. It is now time to start planning the design of our course. Critical to this process, is understanding "where" we want students to end up. Once we have a sense of our end-goal, we can start developing a plan of how we can guide the students to get there.

One effective framework that instructors can use is called backwards design.


### Backwards Design Framework

Quite simply, the big idea with backwards design is to plan with the end in mind. Working backwards is not a novel idea created only within the confines of education; you may be familiar with it in terms of goal setting, narrative writing, strategic planning, or even cooking. Cookbooks have beautiful photographs of food so that you can see what the recipe is instructing you towards. In their book, *Understanding by Design*, Wiggins and McTighe (1998) provide a detailed framework for teaching with the end in mind. They suggest that in order for students to gain understanding, learning needs to be meaningful and relevant. Backwards design is their framework to accomplish this.

So how do you start at the end? Consider what do you hope your students will be able to do, know and/or be by the end of your course or unit. Wiggins and McTighe provide this sentence start to help prompt instructors:

Students will be able to independently use their learning to...

Though thinking about the end goal may be straightforward enough, one important aspect to consider is endurance. Will the learning stick? Will it be meaningful? Will students still be able to do/know/be one year after the course? What about five years or ten years from it? Thinking long term helps to focus your teaching efforts and your students' learning efforts on goals that will stand the test of time. Many educators refer to these as *enduring understandings*.

Now hang on, you might ask, 'What if my course already has learning outcomes that I can't change? Then the backwards design work is already done for me, right?' Not quite. Using backwards design is a shift in perspective. I'm not focused on teaching the content, but I'm using content to help students learning meaningfully and reach the enduring understandings for the course or unit. Focusing on the goals ensures that your learning plan is headed in the right direction. It's like figuring out the how your detective character solves the crime puzzle before you start writing the introduction to your mystery novel.

The basics of Wiggins and McTighe's backwards design framework can be broken down into a three step process:

1. Establish learning goals/enduring understandings
2. What do you hope your students will be able to do, know and/or be by the end of your course or unit ?
3. Design assessments that will measure the intended goals
4. How will you know that students have learned what you want them to learn? What evidence do you need?
5. Plan learning activities that will instruct students to attain the goals
6. What will help them gain understanding and complete the assessments?

Again, notice the order. We're not starting with what content or textbook or activity to use, but with figuring out my desired outcome for the students.

!!! **Learning Activity: Choose Your Own Adventure**
!!! Dive in and investigate backwards design further. Choose one of the following resources to review. As you explore, ask yourself:
!!! - What learning from my course will endure for my students?
!!! - Where is the easiest place for me to start design backwards?

So far, we have explored some important ideas to consider as you think about how to structure your course. We have also considered the process of designing the course. Now that we have an understanding of these two components of course design, we can get started on the *actual* design of the course.

Effective course design requires careful planning and preparation. It is critical that the learning outcomes align with the content and, ultimately, align with the assessments. A well designed course should also include learning activities that allow students to explore the content and practice applying what they have learned. While integrating each of these elements can seem overwhelming, the design process relies on an important resource to help plan the development of creating an effective course: *The Blueprint.*


### The Blueprint

When you hear the word *blueprint*, you may associate it with *planning* or *framework.* As a scholar and active researcher, you undoubtedly recognize the importance of selecting a theoretical framework in which to situate your work. Grant and Osanloo write, "Without a theoretical framework, the structure and vision for a study is unclear, much like a house that cannot be constructed without a blueprint. By contrast, a research plan that contains a theoretical framework allows the study to be strong and structured with an organized flow from one [section] to the next" (2014, p. 13).

To unpack the significance of the blueprint in a construction context, we consulted Rick Olsen of RTZ Construction, a home builder and carpenter with over 30 years of experience. As you read through his comments, reflect on possible parallels between home building and the course design process.

**Q: What is the role of a blueprint in the building and design process?**

A: In my trade, the role of a blueprint is the start of everything. You need to build a house with the foundation first. Once you start with that, you build all the infrastructure and framing, then finish with the "jewelry," so to speak. Blueprints are the first thing. You have to start with the blueprint and detail it out the best you can to prepare for the actual build.

**Q: What are the implications of building a house without a blueprint?**

A: *(chuckles)* Well, there's no such thing as building a house without a blueprint. It just doesn't happen. You need a plan. To execute a plan properly, you need to have detailed designs and a process to start with. If you don't, you're going to be over budget, it's going to be built wrong, and, structurally, you won't have a securely built building.

**Q: As the project unfolds, is there room to revise the blueprint?**

A: Yes. Once you have the "bones" of the blueprint and the actual structure designed, there is always time to change things if you haven't reached the point of no return in the project. If your foundation is set and the structure is in place, you can't really change either of those, but you can change the interior walls here and there. You can change the flooring, lighting, fixtures, things like that. As long as the foundation is put in properly and the actual structure is built properly, then everything else is flexible.

Olsen clearly outlines the foundational role of a blueprint in the overall home building and design process. It seems unlikely that any of us would agree to take part in a home building project without a solid blueprint in place, but how often do we start a new semester without taking the time to step back and design a clear framework for our courses?

In the book of Matthew, Jesus tells the parable of the wise and foolish builders:

Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (Matthew 7:24-27)

When we focus our initial course design efforts on creating a purposefully planned blueprint, we equip ourselves to offer TWU students an authentic, supported, and connected learning experience. In turn, students will be better prepared to weather the inevitable storms they will face as they form connections between course material and the outside world, develop their leadership skills, and strive to have a transformational impact on culture.

Finally, we arrive at the final component of course design. Each section of this unit has added a sequential layer of detail that requires consideration as you go about the development of your course - structural decisions will guide design decisions which will, ultimately, influence how you go about planning out the course (the blueprint!).

The final *layer* we need to add helps bring the content to life. It is important to think about how the content in each section of a course is sequenced as the focus should be on creating an intuitive experience for learners. A student should be focused on learning - not expending energy on trying to figure out how the pieces of content "fit" together. To achieve this, it is helpful to utilize a design technique called storyboarding.


### Storyboarding

You may or may not be familiar with the idea of a storyboard, but, assuming you've seen a movie or watched a cartoon made after the 1930's, you've seen the fruit of this important planning tool. Storyboarding is a critical step in the pre-production process (the planning stage) of filmmaking.

A storyboard is a tool. It's a shot by shot graphical representation of a story intended to be produced as a film or animation. Storyboards are usually created once the script has been finalized but before production begins. A storyboard panel is drawn from the perspective of the camera, and is used to convey composition within a shot. Arrows might be added to show movement of the camera or characters and notes supplement the panel image when necessary.

Around the 1930's, animator Webb Smith, working at Walt Disney Studios, began roughly sketching out shot by shot breakdowns for the short animations the studio produced. These early storyboards were used by the team of animators to pre-visualize their productions and work out any potential problems before real illustration began. This gave the animators greater opportunity for collaboration and experimentation with character design and character expression. Story pace, and camera movement were also worked out at this stage. The storyboarding process improved the overall quality of production and helped with budgeting. Shortly after Disney recognized the value of the pre-visualizing animation, other studios did too.

Today, storyboarding is common practice throughout the film industry. Major studios have a dedicated department of storyboard artists who collaborate with writers, directors and cinematographers to pre-visualize the big budget productions they work on.

Other industries such as marketing, writing, web and software development have adopted storyboarding in one form or another. Having illustrated panels that can be easily reordered and adapted allows problems to be reimagined. Ultimately storyboarding is a tool to convey meaning, to experiment and to see ideas with fresh perspective.


### Final Thoughts

In addition to developing intuitive content, the role of the instructor also includes bringing the content to "life." An important detail of course design is ensuring a course has a "voice" - the focus here is on adding a human feel to the course...especially in an online environment. While there is no simple solution for this part of the design process, developing an awareness of the language you use and the tone that language conveys is important to consider - it also helps to know and understand who your learners are going to be. Another helpful suggestion is to consider adding examples of practical applications of the content to make it more meaningful for learners.

Ultimately the goal is to ensure that the "story" of our content is easy to follow, engaging and relevant to learners in our class.

In Unit 1, we discussed ways to reimagine course design and structure in a digital context. The design process also involves continually reflecting on the way that we assess what learners know and can do.

The Higher Education Academy (2012) states that "assessment shapes what students study, when they study, how much work they do and the approach they take to their learning. Consequently, assessment design is influential in determining the quality and amount of learning achieved by students," (p.9).

Online education provides a unique opportunity to shift students from a mindset of what information needs to be gleaned to more authentic ways of learning. The latter hinges on a multidisciplinary approach and the integration of large-scale concepts.


### Authentic Assessment

The pandemic has changed the way that we develop and deliver assessment.

"Many exams have been replaced by coursework tasks or open book examinations. These forms of assessment better represent the ways in which information is synthesised and applied in real life situations. Tasks that represent what graduates are likely to do in the workplace are often called authentic assessment," (Winstone & Boud, 2020).

Examples of authentic assessment tasks in online learning can include blog posts, podcasts, ePortfolios, client reports, interviews, and learning journals. The aim is to create a range of opportunities that reflect the types of tasks students will come across in the workforce.

Therefore, if we are indeed assessing authentically, we are viewing education from a multidisciplinary approach. Given that the online environment is constantly changing as new tools emerge, digital literacy and netiquette are essential skills that students can develop through authentic assessment.

Let's consider how we can shift the focus for students from "assessment *of* learning" to "assessment *for* learning" or "assessment *as* learning" (Earl, 2013). Preparation for a summative exam might involve strategically memorizing small bits of knowledge, but ignore the deeper relationships between ideas. To that end, heavy use of multiple-choice or true/false questions can limit the broader scope of connections, ideas, and further interrogation of the subject. Instead, a final assessment could take the form of a digital story or an ePortfolio.

Creating a digital artifact would allow students to demonstrate what they've learned about course content, while also reinforcing their digital citizenship skills. It would also provide opportunities for self and peer-reflection, collaboration, and allow students to authentically demonstrate what they can *do* with their learning.

The next topics delve deeper into the importance of assessment, evaluating the types of assessment used, and grading.

🌊 What is the mass of a cubic centimetre of water?

📏 How many kilometres are there between TWU Langley and TWU Richmond?

📚 What is the volume of books in the library?

Each of these questions may be answered with varying degrees of precision as they represent constructs (mass, distance, volume) which may be observed and *quantified*. We can assign not only numbers on an ordinal scale (x<y), but also as an interval (x+1=y; y+1=z), and as a ratio (interval scale with true 0). In other words, we can *measure* the mass of a gram of water, the distance between two points, and the volume of a certain number of books.

👩🏾‍🎓 How much did you learn?

📖 How much do you know?

🎨 How artistic are you?

Each of these questions, by contrast, are much more difficult to answer as they represent constructs which *cannot be directly observed*. These constructs are *not quantifiable* despite the fact that we smuggle in language that suggests we can ('how much...'). At best, and under the most ideal circumstances, we could ask a series of questions to a person before and after a learning experience and compare the results. However, what units would this 'learning' be measured in? How would we know that answering a particular item correctly represents true knowledge of a particular construct vs. just a lucky guess; or that answering that same item incorrectly represents lack of knowledge vs. the effects of hunger or fatigue? Can we know how likely a particular item is to be answered correctly by a person with a given level of ability? How do we know if a particular item is likely to be answered incorrectly by members of a particular group of people (younger people vs. older people).

We have certainly devised a number of proxies for quantifying learning, including using selected-response tests and subjecting the results to psychometric analysis, but those are just that, proxies. They do not *measure* learning or achievement in the way that we often assume they do. For instance, the fundamental equation in Classical Test Theory is

$X=T-E$

where

$X$ = the observed score on a test

$T$ = the true score an examinee would get if their score was based *only* on their ability

$E$ = error; any random variability not attributable to an examinees ability (fatigue, guessing) (Finch & French, 2019)

When an examinee answers a particular number of questions correctly on a test, say, 37.5/50 (75%), what does that mean? How does an examinee, A, who answered the first 37.5 questions correctly compare to another examinee, B, who answered the last 37.5 questions correctly? What about the examinee, C, who scored 37.5/50 and who was up the whole night before the exam because they were called into work a night shift? Clearly, none of these situations are parallel, yet all three examinees end up with the same observed score ($X$), when we know that their true scores ($T$) would in all likelihood be very different.

There is ***always*** error ($E$) when we try to measure ability, a latent construct. The first question is 'how much error?', and the second is 'in which direction?', as error results in both inflated and deflated observed scores ($X$). This should decrease your confidence in the precision of your grading metrics.

Obviously, we want to eliminate sources of information not attributable to learner ability in relation to what our learners know and can do in order to get as close to $T$ as possible. Theoretically, the way to do that, since $E$ is random, is to test each student an infinite number of times and average their scores. Practically, however, ...well...you know.

That brings us to this idea of averages. We saw how 3 learners with different abilities could score the same on a test, hiding critical information about their true ability. A reasonable response to this problem might seem to be to calculate final scores from the average of several scores throughout the semester. We might assume that doing so will allow learners, like C, with higher ability to bring up their final score by demonstrating something closer to their true ability on subsequent tasks. Let's assume that we have a course with 4 graded items, each worth 25% of the total. We might end up with something like this.

| Learner | Item 1 | Item 2| Item 3 | Item 4 | Final|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|A | 75% | 75% | 75% | 75% | 75% |
|B | 75% | 50% | 75% | 100% | 75% |
|C | 75% | 100% | 75% | 50% | 75% |

As you can see, we might have some confidence that A is deserving of 75% as a final grade, but what things are hidden by the scores achieved by B and C? If it seems like B and C might have different abilities in relation to the outcomes, why would we assign them the same grades? How do we know that A's true ability isn't obscured by error in the same way as B and C might be? Doesn't it seem like B made the most progress during the course while C just got more confused? If B was able to demonstrate such mastery at the end of the course, why would we penalize them for knowing less towards the beginning of the semester?

However, the real trouble with using averages is that we are using *ordinal data*. We might know that one learner is more capable than another, but you cannot know *how much* more capable they are. Recall that you cannot *measure* or *quantify* learning, you can only *infer* from learner work and provide a subjective *rating*. Further, if learning can't be quantified, the ratings we use cannot be averaged. For example, we cannot determine the average of the following ratings:

good, fair, good, excellent, poor, fair, excellent, superior

In the same way, we can't determine an average of these ratings:

C+, C, B, A, C-, C, A, A+

*Even if we associate those ratings with numbers or percentages or if we begin with numbers that we then associate with letters.*

For example, imagine a scenario where you receive a hands-free phone call from someone who is looking for the exit to TWU. You ask a series of questions:

- Q: Are you coming from Abbotsford or Vancouver?
- A: Abbotsford

Have you passed the 264th Ave exit?

- Yes.

Have you passed the 232nd Ave exit?

- Yes.

Have you passed TWU on the south side of the highway?

- No.

At this point, you know within a range of possible locations, roughly where the person is on the highway.

![atl-text](assets/tone21/map.png "locating a person on a map"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

It is impossible to know from this data, however, their precise location between 232nd Ave and TWU (even if we presume they are stationary). We cannot determine that they are 357 m beyond the 232nd Ave on-ramp, or that they are 50% of the way through the train overpass. The instrument used to determine their location is not that precise. In the same way, we cannot determine a learner's precise location on a scale that measures ability.

In examinations, we ask questions of learners to gauge their ability. In psychometrics, a learner's *ability* is considered on the same scale as the *difficulty* of an item.

- Item 1
- Correct

Item 2

- Correct

Item 3

- Incorrect

Item 4

- Incorrect

![alt-text](assets/tone21/ability.png "locating a person on an ability scale"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

In this example, we can infer that this learner's *ability* matches the *difficulty* somewhere between the difficulty levels of Item 2 and Item 3. Notice that this is not a precise measurement, but rather a range. The smaller the range between the items (greater precision), the more data we need to gather to have confidence in a learner's ability. This is why using a percentage scale 0-100% is not justified. With this scale, with 101 possible 'locations' is far more precise than our instruments can measure.

The implication of this is that as assessors of learning, we should be cognizant that the tools we have at our disposal are blunt and that the precision with which we can determine a learner's true ability is very fuzzy. This means that we should focus on a few broad categories of ratings as opposed to more "precise" pseudo-measurements. The more precise our categories are, the more likely we are to mis-categorize a learner. It is very difficult or impossible to discern the difference between a paper that is scored a 78% and one that is scored an 80%, but it is much easier to discern between a paper that 'meets expectations' and one that 'exceeds expectations'. Guskey and Brookhart (2019) report that the probable range of error on a 101 point scale is +/- 5-6%, which means that assessors are unable to make meaningful distinctions within 10-12 points.

These distinctions might seem inconsequential at first, but if you consider that the difference between a 78 and an 80 may have implications for scholarships, employment, immigration status, and family relationships, it becomes a bit different story.

![alt-text](assets/tone21/golden-circle-why-simon-sinek.jpg "Simon Sinek's Golden Circle"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

(The golden circle, 2018)

Sinek asserts knowing your WHY "is the only way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend of innovation and flexibility" (2009, p. 50). As we look at the importance of assessment, it is crucial to take time and reflect on WHY we assess learning. At TWU, our [Core Values](https://www.twu.ca/about/core-values){target="_blank"} and [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes){target="_blank"} define our WHY as a Christian liberal arts university dedicated to developing godly Christian leaders. As you continue reading, consider connections between the WHY of TWU and your WHY of assessment.


## Assessment requires feedback loops of learning. {.unnumbered}

Stiggins et al. define the WHY of assessment as "gather[ing] evidence of student learning that will inform instructional decisions in ways that maximize that learning" (2004, p. 14). Notice the authors' emphasis on student learning—under this definition, the instructor adapts their teaching in response to feedback from gathered data. This requires the instructor to be flexible in their planning and follow the needs of the students. White agrees with this learner-centric interpretation of assessment. She writes, "With constant engagement in assessment, we can continue to make decisions about our instruction and how to invite even more learning from all students" (2017, p. 17). Not all assessments require a summative (measurable) indicator of proficiency. When new or complex concepts are introduced, students need low-stakes opportunities to practice, make mistakes, receive feedback, and try again.

! Integrating feedback loops into our assessment practices aligns with First Peoples Principles of Learning: "Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place) (FNESC, n.d.).


## Assessment involves subjective interpretation, not just objective measurement. {.unnumbered}

The learning process is a highly personal and vulnerable journey towards self-discovery. We all experience learning on a continuum where some approach a learning goal with confidence and zeal and others need time and scaffolded support to practice a new skill (White, 2017). As instructors, we should provide multiple learning opportunities by engaging with our students in an ongoing dialogue through formative feedback and inviting their input on assessment criteria, particularly with digital assessments (Bayne et al., 2020). Artifacts of learning serve a wider purpose than solely meeting course learning outcome requirements. Bayne et al. offer several examples of student-nominated criteria for digital assignments (2020, p. 69):

- Production of a deliverable that other members of the community can benefit from and build upon.
- The relationship between technology and content—does method of delivery aid the effectiveness of the argument?
- Visually interesting.
- It should make you smile at least once.

! By inviting student voice into assessment of their learning, we integrate First Peoples Principles of Learning: "Learning requires exploration of one's identity" (FNESC, n.d.).


## Assessment equips students to have a global impact beyond their time as a student at TWU. {.unnumbered}

One of our TWU Core Values is for students to have a transformational impact on culture. We as instructors have the privilege and opportunity to design our assessments in a way to prepare our students to interact in society with justice, kindness, and humility (Micah 6:8). You may already have robust integrations in your assessments between course learning outcomes and TWU Core Values, or it may seem like an unnatural stretch to connect your course content with whole student development. Consider White's question: "Is our work about building walls and documenting who climbs over them, or making sure all our learners have the tools and supports to get over any wall life places in front of them?" (2017, p. 17). When you think of your current assessment structure, reflect on whether students are jumping through academic hoops of content memorization or if they are *applying* course content in authentic scenarios and becoming equipped to integrate their knowledge on a global scale.

! Designing assessments with a focus on building Godly character and preparing our students to glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission ties in with First Peoples Principles of Learning: "Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story" and "Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one's own actions" (FNESC, n.d.).

### Formative and Summative Assessment

In our courses, we often think first of the **summative assessments** – the final test, unit quiz, essay, etc. that sums of students' knowledge. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their learning of the course and we give them a final grade.

**Formative assessments** involve giving feedback and helping students learn from the assessment. This ‘forms' students knowledge so they can further show their understanding of a topic. For example, practice quizzes before a final exam, peer reviews of an essay before the final paper, reflective journals, 1 minute papers, muddiest point, etc., There are numerous effective formative activities to help students and instructors assess learning before being graded.

The image below shows the difference between formative and summative assessment and where it fits into the learning process; assessment *of, for,* and *as* Learning is discussed below.

## Assessment *of, for*, and *as* Learning {.unnumbered}

Understanding assessment is a critical component in supporting student engagement and student success. While many often think of assessment as a final exam, or a "big final project," on which a student's grade is based, sound assessment is (should be) used for much more.

Assessment is an integral component of the teaching/learning process. Assessments are used to not only facilitate student learning, but also to improve instruction by helping to identify the content that students are comprehending, and the areas where students may be struggling. Assessment strategies can take a variety of forms but the end-goal should always be the collection of meaningful data/information that can inform and guide teaching and learning.

Assessment is generally categorized into three different types: Assessment Learning, Assessment *of* Learning, and Assessment *as* Learning.


## Assessment of Learning {.unnumbered}

Assessment of Learning is used primarily to compare students and report progress. This type of assessment can be thought of as a "snapshot in time" that informs instructors and students how well each student has completed the learning tasks and activities. This assessment strategy provides useful information for reporting student achievement but, ultimately, has little effect on student learning. This is also sometimes referred to as "summative assessment.


## Assessment for Learning {.unnumbered}

Assessment for Learning is utilized by instructors to gain an understanding of their students' knowledge and skills. This type of assessment is ongoing and allows instructors to monitor students on a day-to-day basis. For the instructor, this type of assessment helps inform and guide teaching practices so that adjustments can be made to better cultivate student success; for students, this type of assessment provides timely, specific feedback so that they can adjust their learning and focus on opportunities for growth. This is also sometimes referred to as "formative assessment."


## Assessment as Learning {.unnumbered}

One primary goal of education is to support the skills required to be a lifelong learner. Incorporating Assessment as Learning strategies can create the necessary conditions to support the development of metacognitive skills. By incorporating opportunities that encourage students to engage in peer and self-assessment, an instructor can help students learn how to make sense of information, relate it to prior knowledge and use it for new learning. The goal of this strategy is to help students develop a sense of ownership and efficacy when they use instructor, peer and self-assessment feedback to make adjustments, improvements, and changes to what they understand.

| | Assessment *of* Learning | Assessment *for* learning | Assessment *as* learning |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| **Why?** | To certify or inform others of student's proficiency in relation to curriculum learning outcomes. |To enable instructors to determine next steps in advancing student learning. | To guide, and provide, opportunities for each student to monitor and critically reflect on their learning and identify the next steps |
|**What?** | The extent to which student's can apply the key concepts, knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the curriculum outcomes.| Each student's progress, and learning needs, in relation to the curricular outcomes. | Each student's thinking about their learning such as: what strategies they use to support or challenge their learning; and what mechanisms they use to adjust and advance their learning. |
| **Methods?** | A range of methods in different modes that assess both product and process. | A range of methods in different modes that make students' skills and understanding visible. | A range of methods in different modes that that elicit students' learning and metacognitive processes. |
| **Ensuring Quality** |   
 - Accuracy, consistency, and fairness of judgments based on high-quality information  
 - Clear, detailed learning expectations  
 - Fair and accurate summative reporting |  
 - Accuracy and consistency of observations and interpretations of student learning  
 - Clear, detailed learning expectations  
 - Accurate, detailed notes for descriptive feedback to each student |  
 - Accuracy and consistency of student's self-reflection, self-monitoring, and self-adjustment  
 - Engagement of the student in considering, and challenging, their own thinking  
 - Students record their own learning |
| **Use of Information** |  
 - Indicate each student's level of learning  
 - Provide the foundation for discussions on placement or promotion  
 - Report fair, accurate, and detailed information that can be used to decide the next step's in a student's learning |  
 - Provide each student with descriptive feedback to further their learning  
 - Differentiate instruction by continually checking and where each student is in relation to the curricular outcomes |  
 - Provide each student with accurate, descriptive feedback that will help them develop independent learning habits  
 - Have each student focus on the task and their learning (not on getting the "right" answer)  
 - Provide each student with ideas for adjusting, rethinking, and articulating their learning  
 - Provide the structural conditions for the instructor and student to discuss alternatives  
 - Students report about their learning |

!!!! Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts. - Albert Einstein

It is interesting to note that outside of education, the practice of grading is used in the industrial setting to quickly mark whether a product, like shoes or tools or beef, has met the standards to be sold. From this perspective, it seems jarring to simply sum up a student's learning (which is much more dynamic and complicated than constructing a pair of shoes) into one mark, and yet, [as discussed in the Measurement blog post](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21/blog/measurement){target="_blank"}, this is a normal practice. Confounding this, is that often students are left to interpret what this one mark means, and often can do nothing with it. There is growing popularity to get rid of grades altogether, and these voices are quick to reason that grades do not provide adequate feedback or encourage student growth (Blum, 2017; Kohn, 1994). Thomas Guskey summarizes the research on grading in his article, *Grades versus comments: Research on student feedback,* and points out that

We know that while grades certainly have their limitations, they are not inherently good or bad. They are simply labels attached to different levels of student performance that describe in an abbreviated fashion how well students performed. These labels can be letters, numbers, words, phrases, or symbols. They can serve important formative purposes by helping students know where they are on the path to achieving specific learning goals.

We also know that grades should always be based on clearly articulated learning criteria; not norm-based criteria. Grades derived from norm-based criteria — that is, ego-involving indicators of students' relative standing among classmates — communicate nothing about what students have learned or are able to do.(Guskey, 2019)

[details="More on normal distributions..."]
It seems likely that you are familiar with a 'normal distribution', where the mean of a set is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

[![Standard deviation diagram.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg/1200px-Standard_deviation_diagram.svg.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg#/media/File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg)

Some have been tempted to aim for a normal distribution of grades in their courses, but this temptation is misguided because a normal distribution represents a ***random sample*** of a given population. Learners in our courses who have completed some learning activities related to the course content are not a random sample of the population. Consequently, the distribution of grades in courses should be negatively skewed (long tail to the left).

The symbol to represent a student's learning isn't the problem with grading, but how and what we grade is. Grading that moves away from ranking and sorting students (ego-involving, norm-based) and towards individualized feedback based on criteria can increase student learning (Kohn, 1994). These comments can be any communication directly related to student work, and it can address their learning gaps, or their opportunities to grow, and celebrates their successes. Grading for the purpose of providing quality feedback to deepen student understanding shifts learning from a transactional model (I do this work to get a good grade) to an interactional and transformative model (we do this to grow). This type of grading (or learning) also helps students

understand that grades do not reflect who you are as a learner, but where you are in your learning journey — ***and where is always temporary.*** Knowing where you are is essential to understanding where you need to go in order to improve (Guskey, 2019, para. 20, emphasis added).

In other words, students can *do* something with quality feedback.

The alternatives to the historical grading system are not as difficult or more labor intensive as some might imagine, but it does require instructors to focus on what competencies they want their students to acquire, defining what success looks and sounds likes, and then assessing evidence of student learning with that qualitative criteria. There are different ways to approach this and Townsley and Schmid (2020) share three options:

1. Mastery-based grading
2. Standards-based grading
3. Specifications grading

One of the strengths of these methods is that it gives grades more meaning because the learning targets are explicitly communicated and assessed. It also separates behaviours from academic understanding, so grades are not obscured by work habits or other non-academic behaviours (Townsley, 2019). Students have a better sense of "how am I doing in this class?" when they look at their mark. Because feedback is integral to each of these grading systems, instructors can address behaviours in a timely manner and there are multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding. Overall, these grading systems are designed to help students learn and progress competently in their learning journey.

!!! 1. How is grading based on competencies different than traditional grading practices?
!!! 2. What are elements of competency-based grading that interest you? What are elements that worry you?
!!! 3. What can we do with our current grading practices so that they better reflect transformative learning and promote enduring understandings?

In Unit 2, we talked about what assessment is and how to begin thinking about what it means to measure and report learning, and how to use the assessment process to promote learning. In Unit 3, we are going to look at some strategies to help you plan your assessments to increase the validity and reliability of the inferences that you draw from the evidence of learning produced during your course. If you are going to have confidence in the judgements that you make about learners and their learning, it makes sense to put some significant thought into how you come to those judgements. Lipnevich et al. (2020) report that over 78% of syllabi they examined indicated a reliance on summative exams for determining at least some of the grades assigned to learners, so it seems safe to say that exams are a popular assessment instrument, possibly because they are familiar to many instructors, they appear to be relatively easy to create and administer, and selected-response tests are super easy to score, especially if automated.

In this unit, however, we hope to equip you with some ideas and strategies for ditching your selected-response test. After all, it is unlikely to be giving you accurate information about the learning happening in your course.

To begin, let's think about the components of a well-considered assessment plan. The National Research Council (2001) writes about the idea of an *assessment triangle* comprised of three equal and interdependent parts: *cognition,* or a model of the construct to be learned; *observation*, a performance assessment of some sort, and; an *interpretation*, or *inference* based on the data gathered in the performance.

![alt-text](assets/tone21/z-assessment-triangle.png "The Assessment Triangle showing the three components of cognition, observation, and interpretation."){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

Assessment Triangle (National Research Council, 2001)

The assessment triangle is a tremendously useful tool in planning for assessment because it gives us a clear pathway from *cognition* to *observation* to *inference,* as well as clear guideposts to ensure that an assessment plan is properly *aligned*.


### Cognition

The foundation of the triangle, *cognition*, is understood as a model of the knowledge and skills in a domain, mastery of which wold represent competence. This model includes not only the content of the domain but also how learners typically engage with learning the content and in which order. For example, learners typically learn *addition* prior to learning *multiplication* in mathematics. This model might be quite simple at early levels of learning, but extraordinarily complex as the ability level of the learners increases.

Most often, in designing learning experiences, this modelling takes place during the process of identifying and refining learning outcomes, at the very beginning of the process (although it may be a much more detailed process in some instances, such as for domains which require licensure, like nursing or accounting). Engaging in this process clarifies the domain of the course or learning experience and is both limited by the nature of the domain, and also delimited by the choices made by the instructor. The process also makes explicit the appropriate cognitive levels in relation to the outcomes such as learners being able to *recall, describe, compare, critique, analyze,* or *create.*


### Observation

The NRC report describes the *observation* component of the assessment triangle as being a "set of specifications for performance tasks that will elicit illuminating responses from students" (2001, p. 48). It is critical that this performance task be directly and explicitly linked (*aligned*) to the cognitive model represented in the learning outcomes in order to ensure that the inferences derived from the data are valid representations of the learner's ability in the domain.

In the design process, this is done by mapping assessments (i.e., performance tasks, portfolios, test items, etc.) to the learning outcomes and to the identified cognitive skill. For example, if an outcome is "*Learners will be able to **apply** critical theory to issues related to gender in schools.",* then the assessment only requires learners to ***recall*** and ***describe*** critical theory, then there is a lack of alignment between the cognitive model and the observation of learner ability.


### Interpretation or Inference

The NRC describes assessment as a process of "reasoning from evidence" (p. 42). As we learned in the previous unit, and reiterate here, [measuring learning is *at best* an imprecise estimation](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21/blog/measurement){target="_blank"}. In large-scale assessments, psychometricians use detailed statistical models such as Classical Test Theory (CTT) or a number of different item response theories (IRT) to calculate the *probability* that a learner has obtained a particular level of ability in relation to the cognitive model. The trouble for classroom assessments, which are administered to groups that are much smaller than the required $N$. As such, classroom assessment inferences are more often inferred based on more qualitative or intuitive models.

The inferential model used in classroom assessments is important because the inferences we make form the judgements we communicate to the University with respect to how well learners have obtained the required knowledge or skills in the domain. In the design process, instructors should think carefully about the rubrics they use to guide their inferences and also about how much confidence they can have in their inferences.


### Rubrics

The [TWU Standard Grading System](https://www.twu.ca/about/policies-guidelines/university-standard-grading-system){target="_blank"} reflects a rubric that can be used to guide instructor interpretations of learner creations. It provides five clearly delineated categories of achievement and rich descriptions of each category to guide inferences. Another rubric that you might consider using is the SOLO Taxonomy (Biggs & Collis, 1982). SOLO stands for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it also describes five clearly delineated categories which can be used to guide inferences about student work.

![alt-text](assets/tone21/SOLO-taxonomy.png "The SOLO Taxonomy illustrating the different levels of achievement"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

The SOLO Taxonomy

The TWU Standard Grading System and the SOLO Taxonomy are both examples of *single-point rubrics,* which we will talk about more in an upcoming post.


### Planning for Assessment: The Blueprint

In the next few posts, we will work through the process of blueprinting a course in preparation for developing and producing the content. Central to this blueprint process is ensuring that the *cognitive model* of the domain of your course is in alignment with the *observations* you will make which will provide evidence to support your *inference,* leading finally to a judgement in the form of a letter grade.

# Big Ideas

We begin this section with some questions for your to consider:

- What is it about your field or subject matter that fascinates you?
- What passions drive your research?
- What beliefs do you hold as most valuable about your field of study?
- In your experience, what is most important for students to "take away" from their time with you?

Obviously, these are big questions with incredibly abstract answers. They also, however, serve as the driving force behind the big ideas that are inherent to the experiences students will have in your class. The big ideas help shape how student's make connections between the extensive facets of your field of expertise. Additionally, these *big ideas* serve as a connection between the theoretical field of study and the application of the content to the realities of the world in which we exist.


## What are big ideas?

Big ideas are:

Statements that are central to one's understanding in an area of learning. A Big Idea is broad and abstract. It contains key concepts that generally are timeless and transferable to other situations. Big ideas are the key concepts, principles, and theories that are used to organize knowledge within an area of learning. A Big Idea is a statement of an idea that is central to an area of learning or across disciplines and that links numerous understandings into a coherent whole. ~ *BC Ministry of Education, (2016)*

In simplest terms, the big ideas represent what students will *understand* upon completion of your course!

The term "big ideas" comes from  *[Understanding By Design](https://www.ascd.org/Publications/Books/Overview/Understanding-by-Design-Expanded-2nd-Edition.aspx){target="_blank"}*, which lists five major qualities of big ideas:

1. They provide a focusing conceptual "lens" for any study
2. They provide breadth of meaning by connecting and organizing many facts, skills, and experiences; serving as the linchpin of understanding
3. They point to ideas at the heart of expert understanding of the subject
4. They require "uncoverage" because its meaning or value is rarely obvious to the learner, is counterintuitive or prone to misunderstanding
5. They have great transfer value; applying to many other inquiries and issues over time — "horizontally" (across subjects) and "vertically" (through the years in later courses) in the curriculum and out of school

*(Wiggins and McTighe, 2005, p. 68.)*

Just as the big ideas of your discipline drive your passion and your student's inquiry, they also help direct the choices you make as an instructor. These big ideas serve as the cohesive "glue" that allows students to find meaning and connection between the diverse and complex elements of your area of study. It may be helpful to think of your big ideas as thesis statements that frame and organize your course content for students, with the intention of lending meaning and purpose to "real-world" contexts and applications.


## Big ideas and Course Design

In previous sections of TOnE21, you were introduced to the process of "Backward Design." Big ideas are a central component of Backward Design as the process involves beginning with a Big Idea and working *backwards* to develop learning outcomes, assessments, learning activities, and thematic cohesion of the content pages.

Working through this design process facilitates the integration of the big ideas into the course content. With this focus during the design process, you can be confident that students are working towards "learning" the big ideas as they progress through the course - these big ideas will be used by students to see the connections between what they are learning and how it is applied.

As an instructor, the challenge of integrating big ideas into your course design is to choose a **few** big ideas - think of these decisions as what you want students to "take-away" from your course upon completion. These choices will serve as a focus for what to prioritize as you design a course. A helpful approach to this stage of course design is to think about choosing big ideas that are most important to you - this is your way (as an Instructor) of establishing learning priorities and avoiding the pitfall of attempting to teach the whole scope of the discipline in one go.

One final point of clarity that is helpful in understanding the concept of big ideas is to differentiate big ideas from Learning Outcomes. Each course (and unit of a course) has a set of Learning Outcomes that outline the knowledge or skills students should acquire by the end of a course (or section of a course); big ideas are the abstract intentions of your course content that add meaning and relevancy to student learning.

If you are still struggling, some examples of a Big Idea have been provided below. They have been hidden so that you have an opportunity to try developing some on your own. Once you have tried some for your own discipline, take a look at an example - take note of how they are structured:


#### History {.unnumbered}

!!!! Technology leads to profound social, economic, and political changes.


#### Philosophy {.unnumbered}

!!!! Philosophy provides tools for investigating meaning and fostering understanding of different ways of thinking.


#### Economics {.unnumbered}

!!!! The implementation of economic theories has profound effects on social and political decision making and movements.


#### Geography {.unnumbered}

!!!! Natural processes have an impact on the landscape and human settlement.


#### Kinesiology {.unnumbered}

!!!! Fitness can be maintained or enhanced through participation in a variety of activities at different intensity levels.


#### Mathematics {.unnumbered}

!!!! Statistical findings gain value through effective communication.

Hopefully these examples can help you begin thinking about your own big ideas.


## TWU's Student Learning Outcomes

If you are struggling to develop big ideas, take comfort in the fact that developing big ideas is a process. Also, it is important to note that big ideas should be seen as flexible conceptions that evolve and transform over time - these are not written in stone.

A helpful starting point is referring to the [Trinity Western Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes){target="_blank"} page. An important statement that can help reinforce the notion of big ideas is that:

Trinity Western prepares students to deal with complexity, diversity, and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world and helping them to develop transferable intellectual and practical skills. ~*TWU Student Learning Outcomes*

This statement captures the essence of a Big Idea - lending relevancy and meaning to student learning. Additionally, TWU has identified that a student's experience at TWU should support their preparation for a life of learning and service by developing experiences that promote:

1. Knowledge and its Application
2. Cognitive Complexity
3. Aesthetic Expression and Interpretation
4. Inter- and Intra-Personal Wellness
5. Spiritual Formation
6. Social Responsibility and Global Engagement
7. Leadership

Take some time to review these Student Learning Outcomes and consider how you are supporting them in your own course(s). If you are struggling to develop some big ideas, this is a helpful starting point for your own design process as it highlights some of the abstract concepts that student's are expected to understand during their studies at TWU.

!!! ### 💡Learning Activity: Reflection
!!! Developing the big ideas for your course can seem overwhelming - they are, however, a foundational element of course design. This Learning Activity is intended to be a personal reflection that helps you begin thinking through the process of developing big ideas for your own course.
!!! To begin, take some time to consider the following question (it may be helpful to write down your response somewhere so you can look back at it in the future):
!!! - What is the "point" of your course? That is, why is the content of your course important to a student? Try to answer this in one or two sentences that are phrased as statements (e.g. "My course is important because...")
!!! In a recent Faculty Professional Learning Seminar, Christina Bieber presented to the Faculty and posed a number of questions - one of which directly ties to the development of big ideas - take a moment to write down your thoughts on her second big question:
!!! - What is my REAL primary objective here? What kind of person do you want your student to be at the end of your class?"
!!! These questions begin the process of really identifying, and articulating, the big ideas of your course. Once you have some ideas about the primary objective of your course, we can begin expanding our thoughts and start the process of refining our big ideas - the following questions may help guide this process:
!!! - With all of your experience and expertise, identify three or four ideas about your field of study that you wish you knew when you were a student - these could be about academia or about a career in your field.
!!! - *Upon completion of your course, are you confident that students will have an understanding of these ideas? How do you know?*
!!! - *How confident are you that student's understand the "point" of your course upon completion?*

While this reflection will not magically help you identify a big idea, it is intended to help you begin the process of developing one (or some).

Developing a big idea is intended to lend purpose and meaning to student learning. A good starting point for thinking about this purpose and meaning is to consider: *what provides you with a sense of purpose and meaning about your own discipline? What lends relevancy to your field of study?* By taking some time to identify these core values, you can develop a sense of how you can design content in a manner that shares these big ideas with your students.

[notice="note"]
This Learning Activity was structured to be a personal reflection or personal journal entry where each person wrote down their thoughts. These thoughts will (and should) evolve to reflect the evolution of your own personal experience and expertise. The big ideas of your course are no different. It may be helpful to keep a journal to document your thoughts so you have something to refer to as you revisit and refine the design of your course in the future.

# Purposeful Feedback

Purposeful feedback presents us with an opportunity to personalize learning. This is especially relevant in the online teaching experience when occasions to connect one-on-one with students may be few and far between. Moments of individualized teaching can occur in how we structure and present feedback.

Looking back on my own educational experience, some of the most valuable feedback I received was personalized. It was written in a way that expressed the instructors genuinely cared and wanted me to succeed. Their comments went beyond providing evaluative feedback (with the goal of justifying the grade) or prescriptive feedback ("here's how you can improve").

These instructors sought to create a dialogue by expressing the potential they saw in my work and inviting me to become a part of the conversation. They steered clear of making imperative statements. Comments were posed as questions and asked for my input. I felt like a valued participant in the feedback process.

"We should strive to provide feedback to students that conveys high expectations, that we believe those expectations can be achieved by the student, and that each student is included as part of the classroom culture in which we all hold each other accountable to those high expectations" (Freishtat, 2014).

Effective feedback is an ongoing process that encourages thinking instead of compliance. How can we encourage learners to engage with the feedback itself? What are some strategies to make feedback reciprocal? Approaches can include self and peer-assessment, one-on-one conferences, and opportunities to revise work based on the feedback received.

"We learn most when someone else pays attention to what's working within us and asks us to cultivate it intelligently" (Buckingham & Goodall, 2019).

This is not to suggest that feedback should focus more on the individual instead of assessment criteria. However, I do think that we can use students' work itself as a catalyst to engage, motivate, and build confidence. **The key here is to explain what worked for you in that moment and what you experienced** (i.e. "here's how I interpreted this section" or "when reading this, I immediately connected it to your earlier example about…").

"Those are your reactions—they are your truth—and when you relay them in specific detail, you aren't judging or rating or fixing [the student]; you're simply reflecting…the unique "dent" [they] just made in the world, as seen through your eyes. And precisely because it isn't a judgment or a rating it is at once more humble and more powerful" (Buckingham & Goodall, 2019).

Take a moment to watch the video in the following learning activity and consider how you might apply it to your own feedback approach.

!!! > "Great feedback givers wrap their message in a question…[the] conversation is no longer a monologue, but rather joint problem-solving."
!!! 2. Consider the assessments in your course. Are there ample opportunities for learners to answer the questions posed in your feedback? Can they apply the feedback you've given them in subsequent formative and summative assessments?

!!! What do you notice?
!!! What do you wonder?

Feedback that is both timely and consists of ongoing dialogue with students might sound like a lot, especially if you are teaching multiple classes. Instructor burnout is real, and we should address it. In her book, *Small Teaching Online* (2019), Flower Darby discusses "the power of multistep engagement throughout an assessment in helping students find it meaningful" (p.31). I would argue that multistep *feedback* is inherent in this approach.

Brief and informal feedback is an effective way to address misconceptions early. Gentle correction in response to low-stakes assessment throughout the course can mitigate the amount of feedback instructors feel they have to provide near the end of the term. Similarly, rewrites/resubmissions do not have be an arduous marking task. Here, instructors can make use of low-stakes assessments or online testing that allows for multiple attempts. You might also consider group-feedback sessions, where students take on the role of teachers. In this type of peer-assessment, students use the assignment's rubric to assess each other's work.

The evaluative language that characterizes much of the feedback we give, coupled with the looming presence of the grade itself can be intimidating for many students. Frequent opportunities for participation in the feedback process allows students to shape their own learning. It invites them to be apart of classroom culture and engage with the language surrounding assessment.

What type of learning activities do you use in your courses that provide students with the opportunity to practice, to check their understanding, to self-assess or to show you where their learning gaps are?

Recall in Unit 2, formative assessment is about figuring out what students know in the midst of their learning. This is particularly helpful information to let instructors know if they need to reteach or if they can proceed to the next topic or activity. Formative assessments do not always have to resemble a quiz, but can be any learning activity that you can gather information from. What work are students doing that can show you what they know?

In the online learning environment, it may seem like this information is hard to gather and formative activities are hard to run, but that's just not true! We have created these short videos below to demonstrate how to use different online tools that not only encourage student participation and engagement, but also provides instructors with real-time evidence of student learning.

!!! ### Learning Activity
!!! Select at least 3 videos below to view. As you are watching, consider your course objectives and how the online tool could help you achieve them. Also, think about what kind of formative data is generated - what does it tell you and what can you do with it?

For the last couple weeks of TOnE21, we are going to explore various aspects of building community online. It is likely apparent to you that TWU has for most of its history, been focussed on a residential, or on-campus undergraduate model. The primary mode of experiencing TWU has been on the Langley campus, with some satellite campuses in Richmond, Ottawa, and Bellingham. As a result, there has been a significant emphasis on creating and nurturing a sense of community and belonging in physical classrooms, dorms, athletics, recreation, service clubs, and ministry. The pandemic has forced our hand in thinking about what it meams to build this vital component of the TWU experience.

It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

[details="Note"]
[Marc Prensky](https://marcprensky.com/){target="_blank"}, who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as 'natives'. We recognize that this term is problematic when used to talk about people.
[/details]

The essential argument is that *kids these days* have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

[Digital native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native)



Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.


### Residents and Visitors

I'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where *you* reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it's a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else's blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor <--> resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal <--> professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).

I've shared my VR Diagram below...keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.

![alt-text](assets/tone21/vr-diagram-2.png "Visitor-Resident Diagram"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don't spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).

For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn't determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.

If you don't already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called *Teaching in Higher Ed* by [Bonni Stachowiak](https://twitter.com/bonni208){target="_blank"}, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents.

The TOnE sessions aim to promote a sense of community where we learn from each other and engage in rich dialogue. An abundance of digital resources and innovative ideas have emerged from our discussions. Looking ahead to the summer and fall terms, you might be wondering how to organize it all and what ideas to implement given a busy schedule. Let's begin by discussing the planning stage of your course.

**Deciding on Your Classroom Management Style**

How will you set the stage for your class? How will you navigate through common teaching challenges? These questions lay the groundwork for classroom management. For instance, in an online class, how will you set policies for late assignments or a family crisis? Thinking about procedures, expectations, and policies early on helps to define and shape your teaching presence. While teaching online, your role as an instructor has undoubtedly changed and become more complex.

![alt-text](assets/tone21/eric-rothermel-FoKO4DpXamQ-unsplash.jpg "Open desk calendar"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

"The instructor's role in online learning is contested and varied…It is made up of many sometimes contradictory practices, including digital environments, course design, learner assumptions and expectations, the teacher's educational philosophies, habits, and communication styles, and institutional politics…It is, in a word, messy" (Veletsianos, 2016, p.22).

Remember that students are also navigating through a new context, and their position as learners has evolved as a result. It is therefore essential to set norms and expectations, especially in collaborative spaces. Draft guidelines and norms for contributing to wikis and shared documents (e.g., netiquette). Provide tips for successful group- and teamwork.

Consider creating a short video that takes students on a tour of your online course. Setting up a brief quiz of the syllabus at the beginning of your course can act as a quick check on whether students have reviewed the expectations. In a large class, adding a FAQs section on Moodle based on common questions and concerns (especially around major assignments), can reduce a potential influx of emails. When grading, it can also be beneficial to create a rubric in Moodle itself. Lastly, before incorporating new tools and activities, think about the demand on your time, and set healthy limits.

In her book, *Small Teaching Online* (2019), Flower Darby points out that "all of us have been conditioned to technologies that provide instance responses" (p.114). She suggests being "intentional in how we set due dates and communicate expected turnaround times so that our students know not to panic if they don't receive an instance response" (p.115). In an online environment, you might consider a variation of open office hours. Live Q&A sessions based on specific topics and/or assignments would allow students to attend sessions more suited to their particular concerns. Frequent check-ins with students can also clarify misconceptions earlier and redirect end of the term questions. Asking learners to describe their Clearest Point/Muddiest Point at the end of each lecture or unit is a simple way to touch base and reinforce learning. This technique can be employed asynchronously (i.e. via MS Forms) or synchronously.

**Intentional Content**

Building in moments for interactivity in courses can be a challenge, especially if you hope to foster genuine connections. Developing an online course involves determining which tool or activity would best facilitate engagement and ongoing participation. The number of resources can be overwhelming. Intentionality is key before introducing a new tool. What learning outcome does your tool or activity reinforce? As you plan for this alignment, refer back to [the TWU blueprint](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21/blog/blueprint){target="_blank"} from Unit 1 as a guide.

Remember to start small and ensure that you are comfortable with new technology first. Purposefully selected media can have a deep impact on student understanding. Conversely, adding pictures and videos that are not directly related to content can detract from your lesson (Darby, 2019, p.63). Intentional use of media is at the root of critical digital pedagogy. Consider what you want your online learning space to look like, and what this will communicate to students. The digital tools you use should function to *support* a collaborative and creative space for students, not shape it in its entirety.

"A Critical Digital Pedagogy demands that open and networked educational environments must not be merely repositories of content. They must be platforms for engaging students and teachers as full agents of their own learning" (Stommel, 2014).

How we present ourselves through different types of technologies can vary. To this end, we can use certain tools strategically. For instance, asynchronous tools (such as Screencast-O-Matic or MS Stream) allow us time to edit and carefully craft our persona. On the other hand, synchronous tools can be used to encourage more spontaneous and genuine moments. Which tools you decide to use depends on the type of interaction and online space you are seeking to create.

Consider your capacity to incorporate new tools into your course design. Bear in mind that embracing the "messiness" of emerging digital practices is part of the course design process.

!!! ### Learning Activity:
!!! As you look ahead and plan your course, reflect on the following:
!!! - How has your role and "teaching presence" evolved thus far?
!!! - What is one effective strategy or "rule-of-thumb" that has helped you to manage your time?
!!! - What is one tool or resource you have found to be effective in building community?

For centuries, we have become accustomed to defining connection in the physical sense, but as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe it became clear we needed to redefine what it means to be community in creative ways using alternative modalities.

As higher education staff and faculty, we must consider ways to intentionally create community and build connections with, for, and amongst our students in both the physical and virtual classroom environments. In this article, we will focus specifically on ways to use technologies for connection.


## The Importance of First Impressions

When considering online course design, subject matter experts and instructors need to be mindful of interactions between three factors: student development, climate, and learning. Ambrose et al. (2010) write:

We must recognize that students are not only intellectual but also social and emotional beings, and that these dimensions interact within the classroom climate to influence learning and performance. (p. 156)

Notice the authors do not differentiate between physical and virtual classrooms; learning science is applicable across *all* modalities of teaching and learning. In the introductory paragraphs of their book "Small Teaching Online" (gifted to all TWU faculty from Dr. Husbands), Darby and Lang (2019) paint a dire picture of the initial experience many students encounter on their first day of an online course. The authors describe a student wandering through a physical campus trying to find their classroom, entering the wrong door into a room with the lights out and a pile with random desks and chairs, and an abandoned, outdated syllabus halfheartedly sprawled across the teacher's desk for the student to read on their own. Though dramatic, this fictitious scene parallels the very real structure of many online courses, where students are often left to their own devices to figure out course layout, assignment criteria, synchronous scheduling, participation expectations, and ways to connect with the instructor (and fellow students).

To construct a warm, inviting first impression for your online course, consider creating a **course orientation video** to show your students how to navigate through the course and pre-emptively answer any logistical questions they may have. There are many free screencast tools available. TWU has an institution account for [Screencast-o-matic](https://www.notion.so/Technologies-for-Connection-552b7ba2bae14a90a3f764aa1c938359){target="_blank"} and you can gain access by emailing [safe-email autolink="true"]twit@twu.ca[/safe-email] (we suggest trying out the free account for a month or so first to make sure you like using the platform). Once you are set up with your screencast platform, walk your students through the course website by showing them where to find the syllabus, key dates, readings, dropboxes, etc. This gives your students the opportunity to get to know you as an instructor and learn how to navigate through the course before it even begins. You may want to consider having a no-stakes "Course Orientation Mastery Quiz" to ensure students watched your video.

## Exercise Your Tech Muscles

Let's face it: learning something new can be challenging and overwhelming at the best of times, let alone in the midst of a global pandemic! This past year, educators across the world were suddenly expected to be nimble and creative while navigating the seemingly insurmountable mountain of hundreds of tech tools, gadgets, platforms, and apps available to use when communicating with students in the virtual learning environment.

There are several benefits of using technology for connection. Miller (2020) highlights the following advantages of using technology to enhance the learning experience:

We can talk face-to-face with experts and other classrooms like ours all over the world with video calls.
 We can share our work widely with authentic audiences through websites and podcasts.
 We can blur the border of the digital world and the real world through augmented reality.
 We can make learning visible, showing what's in our brains, with graphic design tools.
 We can create audio and video with superb production quality. (p. 10)

However, it is important to avoid the temptation to use technology as a shallow, "sparkly" way to entice students to engage with bland course content. When instructors use technology without a clear purpose, it can detract from learning rather than enhancing it (Miller, 2014 in Darby & Lang, 2019). So how can online instructors spark a balance between using technology intentionally while becoming proficient at using and implementing the available tools?

One place to start is to become familiar with the tools offered at TWU. By investing time and energy into learning how to use TWU supported platforms, such as [Moodle](https://learn.twu.ca/my/){target="_blank"} and [Microsoft Office apps](http://portal.office.com){target="_blank"} (e.g., OneDrive, Teams, Word, Excel, Stream, Flipgrid, OneNote), you can be confident in knowing your students have secure access through the university and will not need to create additional accounts. You can also connect with the TWU Online Team, who are knowledgable on TWU supported apps and can offer 1:1 or group support. Use [this form](http://bit.ly/tonerequestform){target="_blank"} to book a time to meet with one of our instructional designers and learn more or practice your tech skills!

!!! ##### Using Discussion Forums
!!! Many instructors wonder how to use online discussion forums to engage students both synchronously and asynchronously throughout the semester. Moodle has several options to offer students the opportunity to collaborate and discuss course content using forums. [This informative page](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Forum_activity){target="_blank"} demonstrates the variety of forum options available to you in Moodle.

## Focus on People First, Task Second

Remember the story of Jesus' visit to Martha and Mary's home ([Luke 10:38-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42&version=ESV){target="_blank"})? Martha buzzes around the house busily cleaning and preparing the food yet, Jesus blesses the actions of Mary who takes time to sit at his feet and listen to his teaching. The ESV version says, "Mary was **distracted** with much serving" (Luke 10:40, emphasis added). Many times, I find myself striving *for* God instead of resting *in* Him. The same can apply to teaching in the online learning environment. We can get bogged down in the minutia of ensuring our course is clearly organized with intuitive navigation structure and the mechanics of running simultaneous synchronous, asynchronous, flex, multi-modal, and hybrid learning options for our students. This approach fails to consider the humanness of our students and the need to give time and space for them to grow as critical thinkers in a connected community. What would happen if we flipped the priority to focus on the affective side of student learning?

Former Walt Disney World Executive Vice President Lee Cockerell (2008) talks about the importance of ARE: Appreciation, Recognition, and Encouragement. He writes:

Together, they make up a cost-free, fully sustainable fuel, one that builds self-confidence and self-esteem, boosts individual and team performance, and keeps an organization [or classroom] running cleanly and smoothly. ARE is more powerful . . . because it **propels human energy and motivation**. (p. 188, emphasis added)

Take a moment to consider ways you currently incorporate ARE into your teaching and ideas for how to integrate these principles in the future. By appreciating, recognizing, and encouraging your students (and inviting them to build each other up in this way), you may find increased engagement and motivation to contribute and take ownership in an increasingly vibrant and dynamic online learning environment.

## Course Design

When designing a course, it is important to remember that the process is ongoing. While there is no exact "right" or "wrong" way to work through the process, typically development will follow the outline below:

1. **Planning** - In this stage, the focus is on completing the course BLUEPRINT. This is a planning document that outlines details such as the unit topics, learning outcomes, activities, assessments, and resources.
2. **Writing** - This stage involves writing/developing the content for each unit. In the Planning stage, a skeleton was developed; in this stage, we begin filling in the details of what the students will be learning.
3. **Revisions** - After writing the content, it is always a good idea to review each section and ensure that it aligns with the intended learning outcomes. Additionally, this stage provides an opportunity to identify sections of the course where activities or media resources could help to reinforce learning.
4. **Production** - This stage may look different for each course. Typically, this step involves final reviews and edits. Additionally, this stage also provides an opportunity to "personalize" the course and create a space that is unique to you and your students.


## Course Blueprint

When designing a course, the most important step involves the planning phase. During this phase, the focus is on developing learning outcomes that are measurable. Once this has been completed, it is critical to develop learning activities and assessments that support these outcomes and align with the "flow" of the course. To do this, course designers will use a document called a *Blueprint*.

Take a look a the Blueprint template we use at TWU:

Completing each section of this document helps to ensure that our course content, activities, and assessments all align with the outcomes to support student learning.


## Developing a Structure for Content

While Blueprint will provide framework for the development of a course, it is also important to think about how the content (or sections of the completed Blueprint) will be structured. When designing a course in an online environment, it is important to remember to be ***purposeful*** and ***intentional*** with each element of your course. It is not enough to simply upload content to Moodle and hope that students will learn it all. As an instructor, it is paramount that you consider how you structure the content so that it lends itself to the process of learning.

Ultimately, the goal of course design is to create an intuitive experience for learners where the focus is on *learning* and NOT on figuring out how to navigate your course. To achieve this, it is critical that a consistent, supportive structure that cultivates student learning is at the forefront of your course design. Investing in the Planning stage can facilitate this process.

As you think about how you are going to structure the design of your course, consider the guidelines below - each one should be incorporated into your course in a consistent manner with the focus on how it supports student learning:


### Course Overview and Introduction

- Instructions are clear on how to navigate the course and how to get started.
- The Course Overview provides a course description, learning outcomes, and list of assessments.
- There is a self-introduction by the instructor, welcoming students to the course and explaining key aspects of what to expect in the course.
- Learners are asked to introduce themselves to the class.


### Unit Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

- The course learning outcomes are measurable and reflect the course description and level of the course.
- The module/unit learning outcomes are measurable and consistent with the course-level outcomes.
- The learning outcomes are stated clearly and written from the learner's perspective.
- There is a clear relationship between the course/unit learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.


## Assessment {.unnumbered}

- The assessments measure the achievement of the course learning outcomes and are consistent with course activities and resources.
- Specific and descriptive criteria (rubrics, marking schemes) are provided for the evaluation of students' work and participation.
- The assessments are sequenced, varied, flexible, and appropriate to the content being assessed.
- Sufficient and varied opportunities for formative feedback are provided.
- The learner workload is appropriate and reasonable for the level and number of credits for the course.


### Instructional Materials

- The instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.
- Course materials and resources are up-to-date, relevant, and appropriate for the level of the course.
- The instructional materials are free of bias, culturally inclusive, and provide flexibility and choice.
- A variety of instructional materials are used in the course.


### Course Technology

- The technology used in the course support the learning outcomes, activities and assessments.
- Tools promote student engagement and active learning.
- Students are instructed on how to protect their data and privacy.
- All third-party materials are identified, cited and permission requested if necessary.
- A variety of technology is used in the course.


### Learner Support

- Instructions for accessing support (instructor, IT, library, student services), are clearly stated in the course overview and when appropriate, throughout the course.
- Instructors provide support for students throughout the course (e.g. though emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing, and other updates).
- Learners are able to participate in a peer support forum (e.g. Learning Café), for course-related questions or community-building activities.


### Accessibility and Usability

- The course navigation facilitates ease of use.
- The overall course is structured in a logical, consistent, sequenced, and efficient manner.
- Instructions are clear, include rationale for activities and assessments, and provide seamless connections between the various elements in the course.
- The course provides accessible text, videos and images for diverse learners.


### TWU Values and Standards

- Learner interaction (student-instructor, student-student, student-content) promotes a sense of community aligned with Trinity Western University core values.
- Course design and instructional materials meet academic standards for Higher Education (online) learning.


### Final Thoughts

In many ways, "building" a course is no different than building a house - one does not simply put a bunch of pieces of wood together and call it a house. Designing an effective course that focuses on student learning is no different - one cannot simply "dump" content onto a page and expect students to learn.

Much like building a house, course design requires intentional thought and sequential, logical planning. First, one must consider ***who*** we are "building" the course for; next, we can begin planning ***how*** we will go about delivering a positive, intuitive learning experience (the Blueprint). As our planning evolves, we can begin to add details that will engage learners and promote learning - the Blueprint will provide a contextual overview of how each component fits together. Once we have a sense of how all the pieces work together, we can add our assessments with a sense of confidence that they align with the rest of the content in our course.

While the course design process is intended to be flexible and fluid, it is also intended to be intentional and purposeful. Laying the groundwork (Blueprint) is a critical component to ensure we have a strong foundation that cultivates an environment of learning.


### Additional Resources

The goal of course design is to facilitate the process of developing a quality, learner-centred experienced. Below are some resources that you can refer to when assessing the development of your own course:

- [Quality Matters - Course Design Rubric Standards](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric){target="_blank"}
- [Quality Matters - Rubric for Higher Education](https://www.qualitymatters.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/StandardsfromtheQMHigherEducationRubric.pdf){target="_blank"}

- [Best Practices in Designing Online Courses](http://lpc1.clpccd.cc.ca.us/lpc/blackboard/best_practices/){target="_blank"}

Along with the TWU Blueprint (provided above), these resources can help focus your attention on the design elements that cultivate a structure of learning.


## Using Liberating Structures to Create and Sustain Communities of Inquiry


### One Another Relationships & Collaborative Community Building

One insight into community building in the early church comes from 1 Corinthians 12:24-26:

*"God has put the body together...so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. ****If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honoured, every part rejoices with it."*

In the first century church, everyone was engaged. Everyone had equal responsibility to care for each other. Everyone was aware of what was alive meant in the community - the victories and the hardships. There are over 60 New Testament passage with the phrase "one another" (Greek *ἀλλήλων*) which serve as a community building roadmap.

One question for us educators is, "How can the modern classroom or learning space capture a little of this one-another community approach? How can we as facilitators and instructors structure activities in such a way that it encourages everyone to engage in collaborative, compassionate learning and insightful connection?


## Changing the Paradigm

One way to start answering this question is to take its opposite to the extreme. How can we completely guarantee we have disengaged students with "bodies present but minds absent" (McCandless & Lipmanowicz 2014). Here are a few options:

Use lots of PowerPoints and default to lecture 90% of the time (Presentation mode)
 Save any engagement until the last few minutes, ask if anyone has any questions and wait for the most extroverted students to respond (Open Discussion).
 Leave any brainstorm discussion open ended with no expectation of participation, time limits or processing time before discussion (The brainstorm).
 Put maximum control of content in the hands of one or few people.
 Only engage a small number of participants in actual discussion.

The next thought exercise is to consider if anything on this list is something you are actually doing right now, whether to a greater or lesser extent. What could you stop doing to make space for more engagement?

That awareness and "noticing" is crucial to moving out of set patterns and habits of conventional ways of facilitating and moving towards more engaging methods. "The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice" (Laing, 1970, p. 56). It's when we start noticing how we limit and constrain engagement through our own decisions, conscious or otherwise,  that we can start moving towards more intentional forms of community building.


## Centralized vs Distributed Control

My experience in facilitating and teaching was that I had to go through a bit of a paradigm shift, a transformation in my thinking and a "get-the-beam-out-of-my-own-eye" moment to realize that the way I was teaching was counterproductive. Out of fear of losing control, I would drive my lessons to the slide deck, and limit conversation out of fear of what may emerge - opening a Pandora's box that I couldn't shut again.

That fear and desire for control I finally realized was limiting group insights, connections and Eureka moments from happening. That realization came when I was first introduced to Liberating Structures, a growing set of facilitation tools meant to be "simple rules to engage everyone in productively moving forward".

Keith McCandless and Henri Lipmanowicz posit that engagements happen along a continuum from centralized to distributed control, and from having one person to everyone actively and fully engaged (see diagram).

![](assets/tone21/ls2.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

In this diagram, conventional microstructures (presentation, managed and open discussions, status reports, etc) "perpetuate long running traditions" and limits fully engaged participation. Instead we fall into the trap of resorting to these "tried-and-true" methods of engagement while failing to notice what is really happening in the room and how our unconscious decisions directly impact the level of engagement in the room (McCandless & Lipmanowicz, 2014, p. 20).

On the other side of the spectrum are techniques for structured group facilitation, Liberating Structures being a toolbox of examples, which strive for "full engagement" where "everybody plays an active and unrestrained role in contributing ideas, discussing options and shaping next steps." (2014, p. 19).

*Tips for Teaching: Ask yourself, "How am I distributing control in the engagement process? Where am I providing agency for my students? Who is engaged? What is alive in the room?*


## What’s Alive in the (Zoom) Room?

Part of what drew me to Liberating Structures is empathizing with my fellow introverts: the reluctance to be the first to speak up in class, the need to process information quietly on my own before launching into conversation, the need to feel safe in smaller conversational settings.

This explains that awkward silence when instructors ask the proverbial question, "Does anyone have any questions?" followed by a deadly silence. The common conclusion may be that no one had any questions, which is more a projection than anything. There are so many reasons why people won't speak up in that open discussion setting: feeling unsafe, waiting for others to step up, need for processing time to articulate thoughts in a safe environment.

What happens inevitably is that the instructor gets uncomfortable with the silence and quickly moves on, leaving behind a microcosm of unique thought patterns, connection making and insight all gone untapped. If only they were curious and asked the question, "What's really alive in the room?" and then went about unleashing an opportunity for everyone for everyone to engage.


## Rich Dialogue with 1-2-4-All!

Here is where the importance of structured group facilitation comes in, and Liberating Structures has a great set of tools for this. Take for example the structure called 1-2-4-All (you may know a similar pattern of Think-Pair-Share):

1. Allow everyone to spend 1 minute alone in mindful silence, writing, thinking, drawing or whatever they need to gather their thoughts (this step will have all the introverts in the room loving you).
2. Then have everyone spend 2 minutes in pairs (Zoom equivalent: breakout rooms of two with a timer) 1 minute each, to discuss your "invitation" (the question you want them to ponder).
3. Next gather students into groups of 4 (Zoom: allow students to choose rooms and pairs find another pair - or randomize to 4) and have them come up with salient points, commonalities and something amazing they're dying to share back with the whole class
4. In the final stage, "All", gather those discussions as an unbiased facilitator, allowing groups to share back with the whole class what insights they gathered.

The diagram below shows what happens from an interaction point of view within the 1-2-4-All activity. All you have to do is count the number of lines between the dots to see how rich the engagement opportunity is with this structured activity, allowing everyone to participate. The depth of thinking that emerges is surprisingly rich!

![](assets/tone21/1-2-4-All.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}


## Democratizing & decolonizing the classroom

This process -- intentionally and by design -- of including everyone in shaping what emerges, introduces a democratizing of the classroom.  The untapped knowledge in the room can be formed or discovered with the principle that everyone in the room brings value to the discussion. That is a decolonizing, inclusive path to engagement and community forming that ultimately brings about surprising results.

When we invite courage, embrace transparency and collaborativism, practice appreciative learning, allow for powerful and flexible sharing, and ponder "both/and" thinking, we disrupt the cultural and mindset traps that often hold us back from reaching our full communal potential (Hooper, 2019).

By structuring safe environments for sharing, enabling patterns for rich dialogue and mindful interactions, facilitators can open up opportunities for students to learn how to learn together, gather value insights, make connections, and as a result build a stronger community.


## Attributes and Micro-Organizing Design Elements of Liberating Structures

Some of the many attributes of Liberating Structures are that they are:

1. Expert-less: Good news - you don't need a certificate to facilitate these. They require only a few minutes to introduce and novices can succeed after a first experience.
2. Results-focused: Likely to generate better-than-expected purposeful results
3. Rapid cycling: fast iterative rounds are very productive
4. Seriously fun: boosts joy, freedom & responsibility
5. Inclusive: together, everyone is invited to shape next steps
6. Multi-scale: works for everyday solutions, projects, strategy, movements
7. Self-spreading: simple to copy without formal training
8. Modular: the parts can be combined & recombined endlessly

(From: Liberating Structures website: [liberatingstructures.com](https://liberatingstructures.com/){target="_blank"})

There are 5 micro-organizing design elements to every Liberating Structure. In each structures, there will always be the following actions to take:

1. Make an Invitation
2. Distribute Participation
3. Configure Groups (Breakout Rooms)
4. Arrange (Virtual) Space & (Digital) Materials
5. Sequence & Allocate Time

To get a deep dive into what Liberating Structures are and how they enable this type of transformation, please check out this open resource: [Engaging Teams with Liberating Structures.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1wfR4QGBy4c9PDDClZtWk3Z8leo9vtFy8kYsgJH0LS3k/edit){target="_blank"}


## Top 5 Liberating Structures for Classroom Engagement

These are my top favourites I've used in the classroom, but there are many more (over 33 in counting) that you can try out (links are to the full activity instructions on the LS website - and yes they are free, open source, Creative Commons non-commercial distribution):

1. [Impromptu Networking.](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/){target="_blank"} Purpose: Rapidly Share Challenges and Expectations, Build New Connections
2. [1-2-4-All](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/){target="_blank"}. Purpose: Engage Everyone Simultaneously in Generating Questions, Ideas, and Suggestions
3. [9 Whys](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/3-nine-whys/){target="_blank"}. Purpose: Make the Purpose of Your Work Together Clear.
4. [Troika Consulting](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting/){target="_blank"}. Purpose: Get Practical and Imaginative Help from Colleagues Immediately
5. [What, So What, Now What?](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/){target="_blank"} Purpose: Together, Look Back on Progress (or learning) to Date and Decide What Adjustments (or further learning & insights) Are Needed.

These are just a few examples. The important thing is to "fail forward" in trying them out, experimenting, tweaking, practicing and playing with strings of these activities. The more you do them, the better you get at sensing what is alive and wants to emerge from the group.


## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

What can this wonderful, collaborative approach to engaging everyone look like in an online synchronous environment (aka Zoom, Teams or other video conferencing software)?


#### Synchronous LS {.unnumbered}

- Mostly all LS activities in a series of timed breakout rooms with each group as needed accessing collaborative documents (Google Docs, MS Word 365, etc)
- A combination of main room discussion (e.g. [User Experience Fishbowl](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/18-users-experience-fishbowl/){target="_blank"}) and chat participation ([Mad Tea](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/mad-tea){target="_blank"} is great for this).


#### Asynchronous LS {.unnumbered}

- Allow students to self-form groups, timing, logistics leveraging technologies like collaborative documents and scheduling tools (Doodle, Calendly).
- Students find their own time to meet and complete a structured activity in their synchronous time.
- If due to time zone issues, it could be fully asynchronous through use of discussion forums, chat or texting platforms (Whatsapp, FB Messenger), but with firm parameters around response times and equal level of interaction by all members that could have some form of accountability metrics via user activity analytics (this brings us into an emerging field of learning analytics and learning engineering, but we won't go there today)

!!! ### Learning Activity: Your 15% Solution
!!!As a final reflection, take a moment to reflect on your takeaways from this article. "What is your 15 percent? Where do you have discretion and freedom to act? What can you do without more resources or authority to move one step forward in any of the following areas:
!!!
!!!  Engaging every one of your students in articulating their grapes of the learning
!!!  In helping provide a one-another communal space for listening and gathering insight
!!!  In disrupting old and out-dated ways to controlling dialogue and participation
!!!  In decolonizing and democratizing the untapped resources in the room

Anything else? What is possible now? What is emerging? What would happen if everyone was fully engaged?

# Welcome to Unit 4! {.unnumbered}

You have likely noticed by now that this unit looks a bit different from the previous three units, and that is by design. Our intent in shifting to a different format is to show you different formats and course structures in multi-access learning environments.

The remaining units will demonstrate one way to reduce your reliance on web-conferencing (Zoom, BlueJeans, Skype...) when providing direct instruction for learners in your course. As we have all experienced as we finished the Spring 2020 semester, web-conferencing is exhausting! It is not a good replacement for a lecture, it is difficult for instructors, and it is difficult for learners. For some learners (and instructors), it is impossible due to sketchy or limited bandwidth internet connections at home, or to extreme differences in time-zones.

Web-conferencing certainly helped get us through March and April, so this is not to denigrate those who needed it, but it is important to recognize that March and April 2020 in higher ed were far less than ideal.

So for this week, we are going to focus on a primarily asynchronous, low-bandwidth mode of communication supplemented with more casual and unstructured synchronous meetings.

Below this post, you will see what is called a 'feed' which is essentially a subscription to a blog. Each time I publish a post, that post will show up at the top of the feed. Each post will outline some new content and resources for that topic. You will also notice posts from the Library and other faculty at TWU.

Although I am using a blog to keep you all up-to-date, you can do the same thing with a list of emails.

!!!! If you have your own blog and would like to respond to the reflection prompts for this week on your own blog, send me the URL and I will create another feed of participant posts.


## Key Questions

- ...[what do YOU want to know?]
- What does an online community of inquiry look like?
- How can I build a sense of community in a remote course?


## Provocations

Face-to-face interaction, whether mediated through the web or not, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development and growth of transformative communities of inquiry

There are a wide variety of possible learning environments in both F2F and online contexts. You might be familiar with Ferris Bueller's economics teacher in the 1986 movie *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*.

### Predicting school in Y2K.

Or, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France predicting what school would look like in the year 2000. Perhaps Cote was only off by about 20 years in his prediction!

I hope it is obvious to you that not all teaching and learning environments are actually conducive to learning or to building a community. Whether a teacher is putting their learners to sleep, or forcing too much content, or trying to rely on a techno-magical solution, there are problems with all of the learning environments shown above.

Here is my bold and provocative statement for this post...

! Face-to-face interaction, whether mediated through the web or not, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development and growth of transformative communities of inquiry.

I've recently learned of Roy Amara and his 'law'.

[Roy Amara - Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00018679)



!!!! We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

I think it is fair to say that we tend to get pretty hyped about new technologies that promise to make our lives better, but actually don't, while at the same time, we are somewhat blind to the negative effects of technology over longer periods of time. Feel free to push back against this idea (or not, it's up to you).

I'm `not` arguing that all technology is bad and that we need to return to 'simpler' times. I hope it is obvious to you that there are distinct advantages to using technology in education. There are many people who have a hard time learning and for them, technology can enable many activities that wouldn't otherwise be possible. For example, if someone has difficulty processing written words, being able to have a screen-reader translate written words into spoken words can be extremely helpful. Or people who have difficulty writing or spelling can use a word processor to type and provide a spell-check. Or people who are learning a foreign language can use translators to help them understand complex ideas.

What I will argue against, and, again, I encourage you to disagree with me, is the idea that `technology is neutral`. The simple fact that so much technology is built by rich white men who live in California, and who only want to make money should be a clue that the underlying philosophy behind the code that powers technology is fundamentally skewed towards benefitting rich white men.

One example of this in education technology is the use of Turnitin (TII). TII is a web service sold to schools (for tens of thousands of dollars) that they claim will help learners write better and will save faculty time in assessing learners' work. They may be right, but what are the other messages sent when faculty rely on a `black-box algorithm` to determine which student has copied from another source legitimately and which student hasn't?

:::


### What Turnitin tells learners.

Learners are not trustworthy.   
 Learners must prove they are innocent before their work will be graded.   
 Learners' work can be given away to for-profit companies for free.   
 We can trust an invisible and inscrutable algorithm to accurately detect the difference between legitimate and illegitimate usage of other's ideas.   
 It is more important to write so that you get a low TII number than it is to think deeply and carefully and write clearly.   
 The most important work that teaching faculty do, assessing student work and providing formative feedback, can be outsourced to the company with the lowest bid.

So on the surface, a service like TII seems like a benefit to both students and faculty, but if you look just a little closer, it is much less positive.

It is interesting to note that TII itself says specifically that their software cannot ever detect plagiarism, but that is how many faculty use it, to detect plagiarism.

If you want to read more about resisting TII, have a look at this article.

## Key Questions

- ...[what do YOU want to know?]
- Are you a digital resident or visitor?
- How can technology help us start with community and relationship vs. content and mastery.


## Provocation

Digital literacy has almost nothing to do with age and the idea of 'digital natives' (younger people being able to use technology more easily because they grew up with it) is the wrong way to think about digital literacy.


### Activity:

::: {.learning-activity}

Here is a short survey you can use to understand your learners' contexts and access to web tools.

[details="Click to open"]
[Online Learning Readiness Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/73HZ3GS)



[/details]

It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

===

The essential argument is that *kids these days* have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

[Digital native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native)



Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.

:::


### Residents and Visitors

I'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where *you* reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it's a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else's blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor <--> resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal <--> professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).

There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.

![alt-text](assets/tone21/vr-diagram.png "Visitor-Resident Diagram"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don't spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).

For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn't determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.

A couple days ago one of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit.

[Technology is not Pedagogy](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/technology-is-not-pedagogy/)



Please take some time to engage in the following activity.


### Activity:

::: {.learning-activity}

I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?

[details="Click to open"]
 Read [ Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171){target="_blank"}
 Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice.
 Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a tool that falls into the 'Professional-Resident' quadrant for you and send me the link so I can add it to a feed. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others' diagrams!
 Alternately, you can share a link in the Unit 4 Discussion forum.
[/details]

Before I publish today's post on Visitors and Residents, I want to think with you a little bit about why I like the approach of using a blog to communicate with learners.

First, given the current situation, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to produce even one (let alone 3 or 4 for September, then another 3-4 for January) fully developed online course in time for September 2020. I don't say this to discourage you, but to encourage you that there are methods of teaching online that don't require a full learning design team to pull off successfully.

I am using this blog (external to Moodle, then embedded) to compose my posts and updates this week, but you don't need to do that. A perfectly acceptable alternative might be to use the Moodle forums, or especially the 'Announcements' forum in your course to post your updates. An advantage of the Announcements forum is that it automatically sends a notification to all of your learners that you have posted. It is worth noting, however, that learners cannot respond to the Announcements forum, so you would need to provide an alternate avenue of communication for those replies and questions.

I also think it is valuable to be able to manage the flow of content and activities that learners receive. There are times when it is good to make sure everyone is thinking about the same thing for a few days. Spacing posts out to 2-3 times per week can be used to match the pace of a f2f class where content is released on a natural schedule. This can allow you to create a blueprint and syllabus at the outset, then make tweaks and adjustments as you work through the semester without having to make significant edits to already published materials. Also, if learners know that they can expect updates throughout the week, they may find it easier to stay on track with the work they are doing that particular week. On the other hand, there is also a reasonable argument to be made for having everything ready to go ahead of time and available for learners to truly work asynchronously on their own time and schedule.

One of the benefits of learning online is that it provides flexibility for both learners and faculty.

Here is an overview of the synchronous sessions we'll be facilitating during this mini-course. Each meeting will be a preview of the following 2-weeks of course content and activities.

:::


## Developing Community in a Hybrid Course

In order to build a Community of Reflection and Practice (the TOnE CORP), we encourage you to connect with a partner/group where you can support each other, discuss course design ideas, and collaborate. Here is a structure we will use in this course and which you are encouraged to replicate in your own courses.


#### Learning Partners {.unnumbered}

Each learner should identify one learning partner who will be their first contact when they have a question about the `logistics` of the course and expectations from the instructor. Your learning partner will be your 'go-to' person for all sorts of questions about due dates, assignment instructions, procedures, where to find resources, etc.


#### Learning Pods {.unnumbered}

Each set of learning partners will also connect with another set of learning partners to form a learning pod. Learning pods should meet regularly outside of our scheduled meeting times to discuss the course `content`. This is an opportunity for peer review of your individual work, questions about difficult concepts, and other content-related items.


#### Rationale {.unnumbered}

One of the common complaints about remote learning is that both learners and faculty feel very isolated and alone. It is important to provide some structure to encourage learner-learner interactions. Faculty who have used this strategy report that comments show up in end of course 'evaluations' that learners, for the first time in their degree, made a friend because of this course structure. Social connections are critical for many learners. Furthermore, encouraging learners to review each others' work is a cognitive task that encourages deep approaches to learning.

### MS Word

MS Word is likely the tool most people are familiar with and accustomed to using. TWU learners, faculty, and staff all have access provided to the entire MS Office 365 Suite through IT, so Word is a very compelling option for word processing.

However, this is a thing...

> [Jsmdhyxnandialsbamalxusvahbxhcjnskal](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ffwgxh/jsmdhyxnandialsbamalxusvahbxhcjnskal/) from [r/memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/memes)

My point being that Word is grossly bloated software and tries to do too much.

[Voicethread.com](https://voicethread.com/){target="_blank"}


### Course Workload Estimator

[Course Workload Estimator - Rice University Center for Teaching Excellence](https://cte.rice.edu/workload)


### Grav

[Grav](https://getgrav.org){target="_blank"} is a *flat-file* content management system (CMS), meaning it doesn't use a database, which makes it much more light-weight on the web. TWU courses for FAR Centres are rendered for the web in Grav.


### WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org){target="_blank"} is likely the most popular CMS and website builder. WordPress can be used to increase learner agency in learning environments by allowing them to own, control, and host their own work on the web. WordPress is the software behind [create.twu.ca](https://create.twu.ca){target="_blank"} which is available for all TWU learners, faculty, and staff.


### Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.org){target="_blank"} is a sub-category of CMSs often called a learning management system (LMS), or a virtual learning environment (VLE) if you are in the UK.

Moodle is the LMS that TWU has used from the beginning of LMSs at TWU and currently lives at [learn.twu.ca](https://learn.twu.ca){target="_blank"}.


### atom.io

[atom.io](https://atom.io){target="_blank"} is a plain text editor that connects automagically to a Git repository, allowing for the creation of web content in a format called Markdown.


### Pages (macOS)

Pages is the default word processing software on macOS and comes bundled with all new Apple computers. Apple has simplified Pages over the years and learners who use Pages to create their documents need to export them to Word or PDF before submitting them as Pages documents cannot be opened on Windows or Linux computers.


### Scrivener

[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview){target="_blank"} is an app (macOS and Windows) dedicated to the writing *process*. It has a great many features that allow for significant planning and organizational workflows for writers.


### Etherpad

[Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/)


### Priorities

Before recommending any specific apps for use in your courses, it is worthwhile to outline some priorities that we maintain with respect to our recommendations.


### SECTIONS

Tony Bates describes the SECTIONS Model for choosing technology or media in Teaching in a Digital Age.

The acronym stands for different considerations that come into play:

- Students
- Ease of use
- Cost
- Teaching functions, including pedagogical affordances of media
- Interaction
- Organizational Issues
- Networking
- Security and privacy

The SECTIONS model is useful for thinking about technology at a macro level, but taken as a whole, it may not be terribly practical in an instructor's everyday practice.

If you would like, you can read more at the link below.

[Teaching in a Digital Age - Second Edition](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/9-2-the-sections-model/)


### Students

One excellent reminder from the SECTIONS model is that students are always the priority when thinking about technology, or, to be more precise, we need to start thinking about technology in education by thinking about what learners will `do` to meet the outcomes.

Shuell (1986) states the point nicely

If students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacher's fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that `what the student does is more important than what the teacher does`. (p. 429) (emphasis added)

Practically, that means that our recommendations should come from what you want your learners to be doing, and we don't know that yet, so we have made some assumptions based on some of the things that we know help learners learn. I (Colin) think it is safe to assume that faculty at TWU generally want learners to engage in activities that reflect higher order cognitive skills (evaluating, applying, creating, building, imagining, interpreting, and yes, even understanding) as opposed to lower order cognitive skills (remembering, recognizing, duplicating, recalling, stating). This is most likely evidenced in your learning outcomes, and it is certainly [reflected in the TWU Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes){target="_blank"}.

So, before you think about using any given tool, please consider what you want learners to do. For example, if you want learners to interact with each other, how can you do that in a remote, asynchronous environment? What tools should you use? Is Zoom interactive with 4 people in a session? Is it interactive with 20 people? 100 people?

### Our priorities


##### FLOSS

[![Floss (dance).gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Floss_%28dance%29.gif)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Floss_(dance).gif#/media/File:Floss_(dance).gif)

Actually, not that floss...

Free/Libre Open Source Software has been a TWU priority for a long time as evidenced by our long-term use of Moodle as our learning management system.

There are very good reasons to prioritize FLOSS, even beyond the cost. Software like Moodle and WordPress have huge developer communities behind them because they are customizable and extensible with a huge ecosystem of plugins that provide functionality beyond what is available in the core.

This also means that there is no particular company that can disappear, leaving users high and dry. WikiSpaces is an example of a software company that attracted a huge number of educators and institutions to use its services, [then they quit.](https://wikispaces.com/){target="_blank"} Knewton is another example. Here are two articles:

[Meet The Mind-Reading Robo Tutor In The Sky](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/13/437265231/meet-the-mind-reading-robo-tutor-in-the-sky)



The second is from less than 5 years after the NPR article.

[Knewton Is Gone. The Larger Threat Remains | Just Visiting](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/knewton-gone-larger-threat-remains?utm_source=Academica+Top+Ten&utm_campaign=62fac2c01a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_07_04_40&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b4928536cf-62fac2c01a-51939269)

Not only is there a risk of small companies going out of business and leaving users stranded (this has happened at TWU), but there is also the issue of using proprietary tools that only produce files in their own proprietary formats.


### Portability

The key question here is whether you or your learners can export or otherwise take their work with you to another system. Proprietary software often restricts the ways in which you can move your information from one system to another.


### Ownership

Who owns that data that is submitted to a given tool? If the author of the tool claims rights to learner work, we should not engage (see TurnItIn).


### SOLO Taxonomy

In light of the presumptive goal of higher order cognitive activities, the SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of a given learner's or group's response to a provocation. SOLO is an acronym for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it defines various levels of responses, as follows.

![](assets/tone21/SOLOTaxonomy.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

Here is another conceptualization of the SOLO Taxonomy:

[![Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) Taxonomy.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_%28SOLO%29_Taxonomy.png/1200px-Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_%28SOLO%29_Taxonomy.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_(SOLO)\_Taxonomy.png#/media/File:Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_(SOLO)\_Taxonomy.png)  
By [Doug Belshaw](//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dajbelshaw&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Dajbelshaw (page does not exist)"), [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en "Creative Commons Zero, Public Domain Dedication"), [Link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=60807631)

If learners are providing responses at a `pre- or uni-structural` level in a university course, they are going to have a bad time. `Multi-structural` responses will likely lead to grades in the 'C' range. At minimum, responses should be `unambiguously relational` for a grade in the 'B' range and `extended abstract` for a grade in the 'A' range.

The [TWU Standard Grading System describes 'A' work as](https://www.twu.ca/about/university-standard-grading-system){target="_blank"}

Outstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)

For a 'B', here is what learners need to do:

Good, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.


### Ummm...I'm here for the tools...

Here is a good place to start...not with particular tools, but with particular activities.

Hello everyone!

We are grateful for the questions that we have received recently regarding the Fall 2020 semester and TWU's emphasis on Multi-Access Learning as a teaching model. In response, we have developed a mini-course called Teaching ONline Effectively (TOnE) to help you think about and design the scenarios that we will be attending to in the Fall semester.

The course is designed intentionally to develop and nurture a Community of Reflection and Practice (CORP) and connect you with colleagues (inside and outside your department) who are working on many of the same issues as you will be. This structure of learning pods is a high impact teaching practice that we hope you will implement in your own courses.

Here is an outline of the schedule that we intend to follow, beginning Tuesday, May 19, after the long weekend, and continuing for four weeks.


### Plenary meetings (11:00 am-12:00 noon):

Tues May 19 - Design Principles and Learner Contexts
Mon May 25 - Activities and Assessments
Mon June 01 - Building Community and Learning Pods
Mon June 08 - Emergent Session


### Learning Pods

During the week and at times that are suitable for your group, you are encouraged to meet synchronously to discuss your individual questions and challenges.


### Tech Talks (Fridays @ 11:00-11:30am)

May 22 - Moodle Set Up and Gradebook
May 29 - Zoom and Microsoft Stream
June 5 - Web-based Learning Activities
June 12 - Library Resources: Curriculum Builder, Virtual Labs and Research Resources

If you can't make the synchronous plenary sessions, don't worry! We will be modeling Multi-Access by recording and making sessions available after the fact, including transcripts for those in low-bandwidth situations.

Please join our next ‘TOnE' – Teaching Online Effectively session. We are pleased to invite you all to the course to participate as much as you are able during these challenging times.
