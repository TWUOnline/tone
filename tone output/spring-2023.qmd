## TONE QUALITY SERIES

Welcome to Teaching Online Effectively 2023! In the coming months our online team will offer a 3-part series answering this key question: ***"What makes a quality TWU Online course?"*** We want to hear from you as instructors about your experiences teaching OL courses and share best practices in course design. The series will focus first on the structure of building an online course, next on the strategies for making connections and community online, and finally addressing ways to promote inclusion and accessibility in your courses.

Please see the dates below and save the dates!
