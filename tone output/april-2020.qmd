## What is Multi-Access Learning?

*Online learning, blended, flipped, face-to-face, hybrid, multi-access...* you may have heard some of these terms tossed around, especially recently with the shifting focus to online. Before we unpack and examine these modalities of learning, consider how learning in Higher Education has changed. Not just recently with the impact of COVID-19, but the shifts that have happened in the last 20, 10, 5 years. How has technology shaped the way you teach and the way your students learn?


### Activity: Reflecting on Change

::: {.learning-activity}

Skim [Chapter 1: Fundamental Change in Education](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/part/chapter-1-fundamental-change-in-education/){target="_blank"} of our core text, *Teaching in a Digital Age* by Tony Bates. See in particular sections 1.6-1.8.

*Questions to Consider:*
- What changes have you seen in Online Learning?
- What does "online" look like at TWU?
- What changes to you foresee in the next few years and how does this affect you, your course, and your students?

One trend that is gaining traction is **Multi-Access Learning**. Read the following excerpt from *Realigning Higher Education for the 21st-Century Learner through Multi-Access Learning* by Irvine, Code & Richards (2013).

! "Multi-access learning is an opportunity to meet both student needs for access to learning experiences and faculty needs for graduate student recruitment (Irvine, 2009; Irvine & Code, 2011, 2012; Irvine & Richards, 2013). Irvine defines multi-access learning as a framework for enabling students in both face-to-face and online contexts to personalize learning experiences while engaging as a part of the same course. Multi-access learning is different than blended learning because it places the student at the center of the learning experience as opposed to the instructor or the institution.

! Further, "blended learning" is a problematic term due to its multiple interpretations in the literature and in daily practice, leaving one to ask, "Who controls the blend?" When and where the face-to-face sessions occur and when and how the online synchronous or asynchronous sessions occur are often controlled in blended learning settings. At the core, the institution or instructor is in control of the blend, no matter the configuration.

! Multi-access learning, however, has the learner at the center, with the ability to choose how he/she wants to access the course. The core principle of the multi-access framework is one of enabling student choice in terms of the combination of course delivery methods through which the learning environment is accessed; that is, each individual learner decides how he/she wishes to take the course (e.g., face-to-face or online) and can then participate with other students and the instructor – each of whom have their own modality preferences – at the same time" (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).

![](assets/u1/irvine_fig1.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

*Source: Tiers of the multi-access framework (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).*

With the uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, multi-access learning has great potential for our education system. This modality not only brings more choice to students, but promotes a learner-centred course design and best practices in teaching and learning.

[details="Read more about the 4 tiers of multi-access learning."]

:::


##### Tier 1

The first tier of multi-access learning is what most of you have experienced (as learners and faculty) as the predominant modality of higher education, face-to-face (f2f). F2f learning environments are often assumed to be the preferred modality of learning because a f2f classroom allows for rich, multi-modal interactions and robust community-building. This is true to an extent, but only if class sizes are very small; large, lecture-based classrooms present significant challenges to building the kind of critical and safe community for engaged interaction.


##### Tier 2

The second tier of access allows learners who cannot travel to a central campus (like during a worldwide pandemic) to participate in a learning community syncronously via video conferencing. Remote and local learners may exchange items and artifacts and may share video feeds and use software such as Etherpad or screensharing through the web-conferencing tool to collaborate on documents for co-creation of content.


##### Tier 3

The third tier provides asynchronous access for remote learners who cannot join the scheduled class session due to any number of constraints (employment, child/elder care, time-zone, or even network bandwidth). Irvine, et al. acknowledge that simply viewing a recording of a synchronous session, regardless of how collaborative and engaging that session may have been, is a much leaner experience for learners and may not be optimal. This highlights the need to provide learning materials in formats beyond video and audio, perhaps including text-based materials and asynchronous tools for co-creation of content such as GitHub.


##### Tier 4

The outermost tier of the model is for open participation from non-credit learners who are choosing to participate for their own interest and edification. It may seem anathema to some faculty to consider opening their course to the world, but the benefits can be significant, particularly in times like the spring of 2020.

!!!! This course is designed to take advantage of all four tiers of the multi-access model (except f2f for now...). Anyone is welcome to follow along at [multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020){target="_blank"}.

*Questions to Consider*

- What ideas surround multi-access learning, according to the image?
- What is your definition of multi-access learning?
- If you were asked to provide multi-access learning for your course, what initial questions would you have?

So how does this Multi-Access model of learning compare to what you have experienced as an instructor? You may teach online, on campus, or have a blended approach in your courses. What are the key differences between these approaches and modalities?

!!! Before moving on to the next topic, consider what design principles and techniques were used in this first course topic. Are there any you might consider using in developing your online course?

:::


## Key Principles of Online Course Design

If you know any Instructional Designers...this section is at the heart of what we do! What makes a good online course? A good learning activity? How do we facilitate learning experiences that allow our students to engage with the topics, grow in their critical thinking skills, and collaborate with others?

In the next few pages we focus on three key principles in online learning (of course there are so many more!). As you read and engage with the learning activities, consider your own view of learning and teaching, and how this impacts your course design and teaching methods.


## Philosophy of Online Learning

To wrap up our first unit/week of study, we'd like you to consider what your own views of online learning are.

Here are some questions to get you started:

- What is the role of the instructor?
- What is the role of the student?
- How do we learn?
How do we engage students in online learning?
- How do we use technology?
- What are best practices in online teaching and learning?


### Activity: My Philosophy of Online Learning

::: {.learning-activity}

What is your "Philosophy of Online Learning?" Do you design your courses with *experience*, *accessibility*, and *transformation* in mind?

Watch the following video *TWU Science: learning at a deeper level #TWULife*. How do these statements resonate with your experience at TWU?

::: video-container

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYiUMTw_fs0 >}}

:::

Although we've just started discussing a few online design principles, consider drafting your own Philosophy of Online Learning.
Here are a couple of statements from university instructors that might pique your interest.

- [My Online Teaching Philosophy](https://krasun.ca/my-online-philosophy/){target="_blank"} - Dr. Sasha Kondrashov
- [My Teaching Philosophy](https://bwatwood.edublogs.org/2011/06/15/my-teaching-philosophy/){target="_blank"} - Britt Watwood.
- [Philosophy of E-Learning](https://blogs.ubc.ca/shonaellis/philosophy-of-e-learning/){target="_blank"} - Professor Shona Ellis, UBC.
- [The Philosophy of Effective Online Teaching](https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/communication/graduate/online/philosophy-of-effective-online-teaching.html){target="_blank"} - Dr. Debra Davenport
- [Philosophy of Online Teaching](https://briancookeducator.wordpress.com/about-me/philosophy-of-online-teaching/){target="_blank"} - Brian Cook, Ed.D.

In the Discussion Forum for this unit, you'll be asked to share some of your ideas on online learning. For now, jot down your initial thoughts, referring to the questions in the topic above.

:::


## Assessment {.unnumbered}

Seeing as this course is learner-directed and ungraded - this section is what you make of it!
We would love for you to participate in the Discussion forums and we build our Community of Inquiry and support each other in our online adventures.

For this first unit, please see the Discussion Forum in Unit 1 in Moodle. Later on, we may post discussions in our open [TONE website](http://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020/overview){target="_blank"}, but in case you haven't tackled discussion forums in Moodle (like your students have to!) then please head on over to the [TONE Moodle site](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=13628&section=1){target="_blank"} and give it a try!


### Introductions & Questions

Feel free to answer one or all of the following:

1. Please introduce yourself! What do you teach, how long have you taught at TWU, what are your interests, what have you learned during this time of self-isolation, etc.? Feel free to share a picture of someone or something that means a lot to you (i.e. your pet, family, favourite movie or book, etc.).
2. What questions do you have about online learning and teaching? What are you most concerned about or interested in as you move your course online?
3. What is your Philosophy of Online Learning?


## Checking Your Learning

Before you move on to the next unit, check that you are able to:
[fa=check /] compare various modalities of online learning

[fa=check /] examine the problems with trying to use classroom models of teaching in online environments

[fa=check /] examine the characteristics of and differences between various principles of online learning (e.g. experiential learning, collaborative learning, etc.)

[fa=check /] develop a philosophy of online learning.


### #1: Learning is an EXPERIENCE

A key approach in course design is **Experiential Learning** - learning by **DOING**.
Simon Fraser University (2010) has defined experiential learning as:

! "the strategic, active engagement of students in opportunities to learn through doing, and reflection on those activities, which empowers them to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical endeavours in a multitude of settings inside and outside of the classroom."

The **Experiential Learning** model was developed in the 70's by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.

![](assets/u1/1280px-The_Four_Steps_in_Kolb_Cycle.svg.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

*Source: The four steps in Kolb cycle. From Experiential Learning Theories by David Kolb. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Four_Steps_in_Kolb_Cycle.svg){target="_blank"}*

Other key models related to experiential learning are:

- active learning,
- inquiry-based learning,
- problem-based learning, and
- collaborative learning.

In our condensed course, we won't examine these models in depth (unfortunately!), but please see the resources listed in the learning activity below.

- How do these influence your course design?


### Activity: Methods of Teaching (Online & F2F)

::: {.learning-activity}

Now that we've had a very quick overview of some key design principles, how does this relate to online and face-to-face classrooms?

Read [Chapter 3: Methods of teaching: campus-focused](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/part/chapter-4-methods-of-teaching/){target="_blank"} and [Chapter 4: Methods of teaching with an online focus](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/part/chapter-6-models-for-designing-teaching-and-learning/){target="_blank"}.

Create a T-chart, comparing the campus class to the online class.

| *Campus Class* | *Online Class* |
|----------------|----------------|
| - | - |
| - | - |

*Questions to Consider*

- Is there overlap between the modalities?
- Could you anticipate any problems with trying to use classroom models of teaching in online environments?

:::


### Learning should be ACCESSIBLE

We talked a bit about multi-access in the previous topic, but I want to focus on the barriers that might prevent students from learning.

- unpredictable internet access
- confusing technology (pwpt, Moodle, etc.)
- lack of motivation
- lack of support
- difficult navigation in course (e.g. hard to find assessment info, dropboxes, etc.)
- language/cultural barriers

What other concerns have you heard from students, or that you have felt yourself as you encounter a new learning tool?

As we design our courses, we want to incorporate inclusive learning, or principles of **Universal Design for Learning** (UDL). The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 defines this approach to curriculum and teaching:

! "The term ‘universal design for learning' means a scientifically valid framework for guiding educational practice that–
! provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in the ways students respond or demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are engaged; and
! reduces barriers in instruction, provides appropriate accommodations, supports, and challenges, and maintains high achievement expectations for all students, including students with disabilities and students who are limited English proficient" (110th Congress, 2008).

In the learning activity below, there are several resources on Universal Design for Learning. Before you scan those, take a look at the following graphic organizer and consider the steps you can take to design your courses for all learners.

### Learning should be TRANSFORMATIONAL

Wow! That is quite an aspiration! And yet, how many stories have you heard from students or fellow faculty that a course has impacted students in a profound way? Why do students come to Trinity in the first place? What do we hope they gain from this education?

In many of our courses, a common goal is transformational learning, but how do we promote this?


### Activity: What Does Transformational Learning Look Like at TWU?

::: {.learning-activity}

## Purpose of Assessment

Think about why assessment is a part of your course. How does it benefit you and your learners?

Assessment demonstrates whether, and to what degree, the learner has met the learning outcomes for the course. It often lets the instructor know what concepts students struggle with which informs their teaching. Assessments traditionally come in the form of tests or essays, but there are a number of other ways we can measure students' understanding.
First, let's focus on what assessment is.


### Understanding Assessment: Formative & Summative

Assessment can be *for, of,* and *as* learning.

![](assets/u3/FormativeSummativeAssessments.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

! **Assessment for Learning**, a type of formative assessment, is utilized by teachers in order to gain an understanding of their students' knowledge and skills in order to guide instruction.

!!!! **Assessment of Learning** is a summative assessment used primarily to compare students and report progress.

!!! **Assessment as learning** is also a formative assessment which focuses on teaching students the metacognitive processes to evaluate their own learning and make adjustments.

*Source: UBC's [Assessment as Learning](http://etec.ctlt.ubc.ca/510wiki/Assessment_as_Learning){target="_blank"}*

In our courses, we often think first of the **summative assessments** – the final test, unit quiz, essay, etc. that sums of students' knowledge. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their learning of the course and we give them a final grade.

**Formative assessments** involve giving feedback and helping students learn from the assessment. This ‘forms' students knowledge so they can further show their understanding of a topic. For example, practice quizzes before a final exam, peer reviews of an essay before the final paper, reflective journals, 1 minute papers, muddiest point, etc., There are numerous effective formative activities to help students and instructors assess learning before being graded.

| | **Summative Assessment** | **Formative Assessment** |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When | At the end of a learning activity | During a learning activity |
| Goal | To make a decision | To improve learning |
| Feedback | Final judgement | Return to material |
| Frame of Reference | Sometimes normative (comparing each student against all others); sometimes criterion | Always criterion (evaluating students according to the same criteria) |

*Table from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formative_assessment#cite_note-11){target="_blank"} citing Charting your course: How to prepare to teach more effectively, Atwood, 2000.*


### Alignment in Course Design

So how do we choose formative and summative assessemnts for our course? An important part of course design is checking that there is alignment between assessments and learning outcomes. If your learning outcome asks students to compare two theories, for example, how do they show you they can do that? Often instructors will have their assessments in mind before they write their learning outcomes. Whatever process you have, make sure that your course learning outcomes are assessed in your assignments. Try to include these connections in your syllabus, as in the example below:
![](assets/u3/course-assessment.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}


### Promoting Experiential Learning, Accessibility & Transformation

Let's refer back to Unit 1 and our key ideas that Learning should be an Experience, it should be Accessible, and it should be Transformational. Do your learning activities and assessments promote these principles?

In [Engaging Adult Learners: Philosophy, Principles and Practices](http://northernc.on.ca/leid/docs/engagingadultlearners.pdf){target="_blank"}, Jim Bryson suggest 5 questions to ask yourself when choosing activities/assessments:

! 1. Are the instructions, the purpose and the intended learning outcome(s) for this activity clear enough to be correctly understood by all students?
! 1. Is this activity fair? Will all students be able to understand and participate in it as a learning exercise? What choices do they have? Is it related to course content and laid out in a logical manner?
! 1. Will this activity add to my students' interest in content? Will they find it engaging and motivating? Will it stimulate curiosity and participation?
! 1. Is this activity relevant to the intended learning outcomes for the course? Is it relevant to student expectations? To my instructional goals?
! 1. Have I provided support for success in terms of information, curriculum content, discussion, interaction, activities and available resources?

As you decide what activities/assessments are appropriate for your course, refer back to these questions.

Next, consider the following quote:
!! ‘Can transformative learning theory be put into practice, and if yes, what are some of the differences it makes to the lives of learners?'...
!! ‘Can disorienting dilemmas be triggered by carefully designed exercises, and, if yes, what are the effects on student transformative learning?'
!! *From [Putting transformative learning theory into practice](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1059138.pdf){target="_blank"}*.

How do we carfeully design exercises (activities & assessments) that transform learners? How do we give them opportunities to explore and challenge their thinking?

Watch the following video about Trinity's Inquiry-Based Learning approach.

:::

*Questions to Consider:*

Before you move on to the learning activity, take a moment to jot down your thoughts on these questions:

- Why do we assess?
- How do I assess my students?
- Are there opportunities for students to practice what they are learning before an assessment?
- Do I give formative feedback that will help students be more successful in future assignments?
- How do I design learning experiences that facilitate discovery, exploration, questioning, transformation, etc.?

### Activity & Assessment Ideas

::: {.learning-activity}

This topic is all about exploration and sharing. We'll present a number of engaging learning activities with a range of purposes:

- First and foremost, the learning activity must align with your course/unit learning outcomes.
- Activities should also connect to assessments, allowing learners to practice and prepare for assignments.
- In addition to your listed learning outcomes, there may be other skills the activities promote, including: collaboration, critical and creative thinking, quantitative and qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information literacy. (See TWU's [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes){target="_blank"}.)

As you explore the ideas and the links provided in this unit, you are encouraged to add your comments, ideas, experiences to our **shared chalkboard** (see chart below or click [here](https://padlet.com/kelly_marjanovic/mtxqc9gvjy5z0zp5){target="_blank"} for Padlet).
Please let us know what activities/assignments have worked well in your class, or which you would like to try. Perhaps share a link to a google doc of assignment instructions, or add a picture/screenshot of the activity. This is our opportunity to develop our **Community of Practice** - to share resources, experiences, and encouragement.

In the next several pages, we're going to explore some common activity/assessment types in online courses.

- **Please note** that not all of these activity and assessment types will work for your course! Focus on what will help students practice and achieve the learning outcomes.

Now, let's dive into our idea smorgasbord!

:::


## Grading Rubrics & Peer Assessment


### Grading with Rubrics

When giving students an assignment, it is crucial to explain to them exactly what you're looking for and how you will assess their work. A rubric is one tool that can be used to authentically assess learners. It contains the list of criteria that highlights the what the learner is expected to do or demonstrate. Along with the criteria, a rubric provides examples of what is expected at each level of performance, from poor to excellent. Providing this criteria up front to learners allows them to assess their progress and compare to a performance level.

Below are some examples of rubric use in our online courses.

![](assets/u3/discussion-grading.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

![](assets/u3/essay-rubric.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

![](assets/u3/paper-rubric.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

![](assets/u3/article-rubric.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

![](assets/u3/phil-210-rubric.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

You'll notice the last two in particular have a detailed range of "Needs Improvement" to "Exceeds Expectations". If possible, try to work out the details of what you're looking for at each level of mastery. This helps not only when you're grading students' work, but also when you need to explain the grade you gave.


### Peer Feedback

One last important topic to cover in our assessment unit is about the value of peer feedback.
Peer assessment can:

- improve student work/performance
- offer timely feedback
- reduce grading workload
- help make your grading criteria more clear (as students use it to evaluate their peers)
- allow for critical reflection (of students' own work & their peers)

To this last point, consider as well asking students to self-evaluate their work, acknowledging feedback from peers and/or the instructor and setting goals for improvement.

## Course Design Process

Imagine you win the lottery and have a couple million dollars to design your dream house. What would it look like? Where would it be? Who would live in it with you?

If you actually had to do the work to map out the blueprint of your house, what are the components? What is the layout and design? What motivates you to make those design choices?

![alt-text](assets/u2/rm22-268-business-sasi-22.jpg "Woman holding a poster on a white wall"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

Designing a course is like planning, building, and moving into a house. You start with asking some key questions:

- What is the course? What are the ‘big picture‘ ideas, or the main take-aways?
- How does this course fit in with the program?
- If a previous course exists, has there been any feedback from students and instructors?
…and the most important questions:
- Who are the students? What is the typical age, gender, work experience, culture, etc.? What are their interests, learning styles, and needs?​

Another strategy to use before getting into the details of a course is identifying the **Big Ideas** (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Below is an image from Stanford University (adapted) that takes us through the process of deciding the big ideas, essential questions, key knowledge and skills, and learning activities.

![alt-text](assets/u2/big_ideas_los.png "Big ideas template"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}


### Activity: What's Your Metaphor?

::: {.learning-activity}

Before we get into more of the design process and models, what's your metaphor for designing a course? Does it seem like an impromptu marathon that is sprung on you, or a paced cooking experience where you can get creative with your own recipe? How about following the "easy" directions in assembling a child's toy?

Whatever your guiding metaphor is, consider your first steps. What are the big ideas of your course? What are the needs of your students?

As we move forward in course planning, select a course you'd like to focus on in these three weeks we have together. What are your key needs as we map out your course?

In the next sections, we'll have a closer look at the design models that influence us, as well as the course design process at TWU.

:::


## Anatomy of an Online Course

Here is where we get into the nitty-gritty of what a course looks like! Again, let me repeat that every course is different and may not have these elements.

In the course planning BLUEPRINT, we outline the topics of the course, the learning outcomes for each topic, the assessments, and the resources. Sometimes we can plan out the formative learning activities, but often we add those throughout the unit writing process.

In this next sections, we'll share what a typical unit looks like.


## Ensuring Quality in Online Learning Design

What is a *quality online course*? Take a moment to jot down some thoughts.

When we assess the quality of an online course, many course designers turn to the **[Quality Matters rubric for Higher Education](https://www.qualitymatters.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/StandardsfromtheQMHigherEducationRubric.pdf){target="_blank"}**. Have a quick look at the link and we'll expand on the elements in a bit. As you skim the sections, pay attention to the key feature of alignment.

! "Unique to the QM Rubric is the concept of Alignment. This occurs when critical course components — Learning Objectives (Competencies) (2.1, 2.2), Assessment and Measurement (3.1), Instructional Materials (4.1), Learning Activities and Learner Interaction (5.1), and Course Technology (6.1) — work together to ensure students achieve desired learning outcomes." - *From [QM Course Design Rubric Standards](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric){target="_blank"}*.

At TWU, we have slightly modified the rubric to align with our own Trinity standards of values for teaching and learning.

As you read the following guidelines, consider how you can incorporate them into your course design.


### #1: Course Overview and Introduction

• Instructions are clear on how to navigate the course and how to get started.

• The Course Overview provides a course description, learning outcomes, and list of assessments.

• There is a self-introduction by the instructor, welcoming students to the course and explaining key aspects of what to expect in the course.

• Learners are asked to introduce themselves to the class.


### #2: Learning Outcomes

• The course learning outcomes are measurable and reflect the course description and level of the course.

• The module/unit learning outcomes are measurable and consistent with the course-level outcomes.

• The learning outcomes are stated clearly and written from the learner's perspective.

• There is a clear relationship between the course/unit learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.


### #3: Assessment

• The assessments measure the achievement of the course learning outcomes and are consistent with course activities and resources.

• Specific and descriptive criteria (rubrics, marking schemes) are provided for the evaluation of students' work and participation.

• The assessments are sequenced, varied, flexible, and appropriate to the content being assessed.

• Sufficient and varied opportunities for formative feedback are provided.

• The learner workload is appropriate and reasonable for the level and number of credits for the course.


### #4: Instructional Materials

• The instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.

• Course materials and resources are up-to-date, relevant, and appropriate for the level of the course.

• The instructional materials are free of bias, culturally inclusive, and provide flexibility and choice.

• A variety of instructional materials are used in the course.


### #5: Learning Activities and Learner Interaction

• Learning activities support learners in achieving the learning outcomes and completing assessments.
• Learning activities provide scaffolding opportunities for building foundational knowledge and skills within the course.

• Learning activities foster student-instructor, student-content, and if appropriate to the course, student-student interaction.

• The requirements for learner interaction are clearly stated.


### #6: Course Technology

• The technology used in the course support the learning outcomes, activities and assessments.

• Tools promote student engagement and active learning.

• Students are instructed on how to protect their data and privacy.

• All third-party materials are identified, cited and permission requested if necessary.

• A variety of technology is used in the course.


### #7: Learner Support

• Instructions for accessing support (instructor, IT, library, student services), are clearly stated in the course overview and when appropriate, throughout the course.

• Instructors provide support for students throughout the course (e.g. though emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing, and other updates).

• Learners are able to participate in a peer support forum (e.g. Learning Café), for course-related questions or community-building activities.


### #8: Accessibility and Usability

• The course navigation facilitates ease of use.

• The overall course is structured in a logical, consistent, sequenced, and efficient manner.

• Instructions are clear, include rationale for activities and assessments, and provide seamless connections between the various elements in the course.

• The course provides accessible text, videos and images for diverse learners.


### #9: TWU Values and Standards

• Learner interaction (student-instructor, student-student, student-content) promotes a sense of community aligned with Trinity Western University core values.

• Course design and instructional materials meet academic standards for Higher Education (online) learning.

Later on, we may post discussions in our open [TONE website](http://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020/overview){target="_blank"}, but in case you haven't tackled discussion forums in Moodle (like your students have to!) then please head on over to the Discussion forum and give it a try!


### Unit 2 Discussion: Course Design Process

Feel free to answer one or all of the following:

1. What ideas seem helpful to you as you start to plan and design your course?
2. What course elements can you include in your design now? What will you implement later?
3. What key questions to you have about online course design?


## Checking Your Learning

Before you move on to the next unit, check that you are able to:

consider the process for designing a course and what techniques apply to your own course design;

describe the ADDIE and Backwards Design models of instructional design;

discuss the components in an online unit of study, and the variety of approaches to present content;

write effective learning outcomes that are linked to the assessment and learning activities in a unit;

examine the standards used to evaluate the design of online and blended courses.


### Reflective Journals

What is your experience with passive learners? Those students who may sit in your class, read their texts, hand in assignments, but aren't really engaged in their learning? Imagine now a more self-directed online course, where those same students get to *choose* whether to study the resources presented; they *choose* whether to listen to your video lectures, engage in online discussion forums, complete ungraded learning activities...how do you motivate these students to become **ACTIVE** learners?

One strategy that helps students become not only active learners, but reflective learners, is to promote **Reflective Learning**. This can be a part of several assignment types, but for now, let's focus on **Reflective Journals**. This type of assignment can be structured with specific questions (related to the learning outcomes), or unstructured, allowing the learner to explore and reflect in their own way.


#### Ungraded Reflective Journals {.unnumbered}

Reflective Journals are common graded assignments, but they can also be used as ungraded learning activities to promote note-taking, reflection, critical thinking, etc.

For example, in some of our online courses we often have this note for students when we explain the ungraded learning activities in a unit:

!! Note that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. You are strongly encouraged to complete them, as they are designed to help you succeed in your course assessments. You are encouraged to write your responses in a **Reflective Learning Journal** and refer back to your notes as you complete your assignments.

Make the connection to assessment explicit as you encourage learners to engage in the activity, write their notes in a journal, and study these notes to prepare for assignments.


#### Graded Reflective Journals {.unnumbered}

As a graded assignment, consider allowing students some flexibility in how they present their learning process.

Here are some sample instructions we use in our online courses:

Sample 1: **Introduction to the Reflective Journal**
!!!! A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.
!!!! The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course's readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.
!!!! Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.

Sample 2: **Journal Instructions**
!!! Note that for this course, you will keep a **Reflective Learning Journal**, which will provide the basis for many of your assignments. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, and apply to other contexts.

!!! As you read and watch the resources in this unit, consider the following questions:
!!! 1. In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a **summary sentence** for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a transformational leader.
!!! 1. Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a **short paragraph summary** of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context.
!!! 1. Formulate **one question** that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and assignments.
!!! As you prepare your assignments, refer to these notes.

Sample 3: **Journal Instructions**
! Answer the following questions in your Reflective Journal:
! 1. What terms were the most important concepts of this week's lesson? Be sure to define any important terms in your own words. (2 paragraphs)
! 2. What was your muddiest point (that is, what did not make sense)? (1 paragraph).
! 3. What would you like to know more about from this lesson, and why? (1 paragraph)
! 4. How does this lesson relate to something you have already learned outside of this class? (1 paragraph)
! 5. Why do you think you were required to learn this content? (1 paragraph)

### Discussions & Blogs


#### Discussions Forums {.unnumbered}

Discussion forums are a popular form of assessment for online courses. Which means, if students are taking several online courses at once...there is a certain amount of *forum fatigue* they may experience! Be sure to craft your discussion questions in a way that meets the unit learning outcomes, but also inspires collaboration, inquiry, and critical thinking.

In the activity below there are several resources and guides for facilitating discussions. In particular, pay attention to the various activity types you can have in discussion forums. For example:

1. **Web Field Trips**: Instructor provides a link or a series of links. Students follow the link(s) and report back through an instructor-defined set of questions.
2. **Brainstorming**: Students set forth a series of ideas on a given topic without evaluation.
3. **Problem-Solving**: Small groups work out a solution to a problem.
4. **Writing Groups**: Students work together in groups of four or five to share drafts and provide peer response and peer-editing.
5. **Case Analysis**: Students work independent on a common case followed by group analysis in the board.
6. **Collaborative Writing**: Workgroups work together to create a single document – proposals and analytical reports work well – which they then post to the larger group for critique.
7. **Cooperative Debate**: Workgroups present perspectives on a particular issue, followed by a whole group consensus-building discussion.
8. **Discussions of Course Readings**: Instructor creates threaded discussions
around assigned readings. Threads may include pre-reading (anticipation) activities, interpretations, evaluations, etc.
9. **Research Bank**: Students and instructor contribute links and citations to a common area for a classwide research topic.

#### Blogs {.unnumbered}

[![BLOGS for Collaborative Learning & Peer Review, @calanthaelsby #tli2012](https://live.staticflickr.com/8167/6986908720_ea4318d167.jpg)](https://flickr.com/photos/gforsythe/6986908720 "BLOGS for Collaborative Learning & Peer Review, @calanthaelsby #tli2012")

Another reflective learning tool is a blog. It may take some courage for some students to post their thoughts online (and for faculty to step out of Moodle), but it can be very effective in helping students demonstrate their learning.

It's important to let students know that blogs can be kept private. Students can share their link with their instructor, or post their link on Moodle so other students can see. It's important to go over privacy considerations with students, as well as [netiquette guidelines](http://teach.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NetiquetteGuideforOnlineCourses.pdf){target="_blank"}

Here are some benefits to consider from [How Do Blogs Support Learning?](https://resources.depaul.edu/teaching-commons/teaching-guides/technology/other-teaching-tools/Pages/blogs.aspx){target="_blank"}

- **Blogs help grow learning communities** by allowing students to share their own perspectives and experiences while learning about those of their classmates.
- **Blogs let students take ownership of their learning**, offering them a space to tease out tough problems, explore possible solutions, and basically do the hard work that critical thinking requires.
- **Blogs encourage creativity of expression** by giving students a platform to experiment with a variety of genres, allowing for the unique personalities of both students and faculty to emerge.
- **Blogs create multimodal spaces capable of hosting a wide variety of multimedia**: oftentimes images, audio, video, and other media can communicate ideas more effectively than written text.
- **Blogs give students opportunities to address audiences other than their professors:** their posts could be read by other students, their parents, and visitors from across the globe.
- **Blogs foster opportunities for reflection** and provide them with tangible evidence of their learning over time: students can look at their previous posts to identify recurrent patterns in their thinking, times of change or growth, and other markers of learning and development.
- **Blogs familiarize students with widely-used web content platforms**: The knowledge and skills gained by writing and maintaining a blog are transferrable to a wide variety of work contexts, as blogging platforms (particularly Wordpress) power an increasing number of websites around the world.

Tony Bates also promotes blogs as he discussing [Open pedagogy](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-4-open-pedagogy/){target="_blank"} in *Teaching in a Digital Age*. He quotes Hegarty (2015), in describing eight attributes of open pedagogy. Consider how your class blogs can impact more than just your class.

- **participatory technologies**: socially constructed media such as blogs, wikis and other ‘sharing' social media;
people, openness and trust: students' willingness to learn is fragile, with participation and interactions unlikely to flourish unless an element of trust can be built (Mak et., 2010);
- **innovation and creativity**: finding new models of teaching and learning that better exploit OER and more emphasis on choosing digital technologies and methods that encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources;
- **sharing ideas and resources**: an open pedagogy needs peers to share willingly within a connected and trusting and professional community;
- **connected community**: a technologically linked community with common interests;
- **learner-generated**: this requires ‘opening up' the process to empower students to take the lead, solve problems, and work collectively to produce artifacts that they share, discuss, reconfigure, and redeploy
- **reflective practice**: when students and teachers collaborate in partnerships, it facilitates deeper pedagogical reflection
- **peer review**: Conole (2014) sees learners as publishers and users of a range of open tools, with peer interactions and critique embedded in the learning experience.

(2015) Attributes of open pedagogy: a model for using open educational resources Educational Technology, July-August* Referenced in section 11.4 [Open pedagogy](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-4-open-pedagogy/){target="_blank"} in *Teaching in a Digital Age* by Tony Bates.

- [Teaching with Blogs](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-with-blogs/){target="_blank"}

Note that WordPress is a common blogging website used at Trinity and all first year students are required to set up and use a blog for their Foundations courses. See this [WordPress Guide](http://create.twu.ca/help/wordpress/basics/wordpress-guide){target="_blank"} to set up your own account and get started with blogging! It can also be used for a course website, rather than have content in Moodle. (We also use [Grav](https://getgrav.org/){target="_blank"} as an alternative to WordPress, so please chat with our online team for options that best suit you, your course, and your learners!)

*Questions to Consider:*

- Would you use a blog activity/assessment in your course? For what purpose?

- What are the key challenges for you as the instructor and for your students?

:::


### Portfolios

Portfolios, whether electronic or otherwise, are another common type of assessment in online courses.

Clemson University (n.d.) categorizes portfolios into three main types:

1. **Showcase portfolio**: Highlights achievements.
2. **Learning portfolio**: Demonstrates the learning process with a focus on feedback.
3. **Assessment portfolio**: Used to assess students' competency on certain standards or topics.

*Source: [Wiley Education Services - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wiley.com/e-portfolios-and-their-uses-in-higher-education/){target="_blank"}*

Scully et al. (2018) explains that in the university context, "learning portfolios are typically used with the dual intention of (i) encouraging critically self-reflective lifelong learning and (ii) gathering evidence of broad skills and competencies that may enhance future employment prospects" (p.iii). The authors warn portfolios are only effective if instructors and learners understand the process of reflection. "**Effortful design, explicit scaffolding and sufficient time are needed**" (p.10).

If you've ever created a portfolio yourself, you know it takes a lot of reflection and critical thinking as you select evidence of your learning or achievements. An ePortfolio in particular adds an element of vulnerability, as learners may share their successes and struggles openly. This is a great opportunity for peers to learn the process/products of learning from each other.

Skim the resources in the activity below and consider whether portfolios will help your students demonstrate the learning outcomes for your course.


### Activity: Resources on Portfolios

::: {.learning-activity}

Select from the following resources:

- [Guidelines for ePortfolios in Higher Education](https://www.eduhub.ch/export/sites/default/files/Guidelines_ePortfolio.pdf){target="_blank"}

- [ePortfolios](https://www.aacu.org/eportfolios){target="_blank"} from the Association of American Colleges & Universities. This has a couple interesting examples of portfolios for learning, assessment, and employment.

*Questions to Consider:*

- Do your students need to demonstrate a process of learning, or critically reflect on their work? Would a portfolio help them achieve those outcomes?

- What are some questions or concerns you have about ePortfolios?

### Quizzes

Test, exams, quizzes…these are essential to many courses, however, there is definitely an art to designing an effective and fair test. An what about online tests? How do we prevent students from cheating...or confirm the identity of the test-taker? Several questions arise when designing tests for online courses. First, let's pause and consider the use and effectiveness of formative, ungraded tests.


#### Formative Quizzes {.unnumbered}

In our online courses, we think about the assessments and whether students have enough guidance and practice. For low-level memorization of key terms for example, you could create flashcards or quizzes (e.g. matching, fill-in-the blank, multiple choice, etc.). Yes, it may take some time to create, but our online team can help you! Once we receive the terms and definitions from instructors we typically use [h5P](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications){target="_blank"}, an open source application that seamlessly integrates into Moodle (and other websites).

Here are some examples from our courses:

*Sample 1: [Flashcards](https://h5p.org/flashcards){target="_blank"}*

<iframe src="https://create.twu.ca/h5p/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=h5p_embed&id=29" width="789" height="1179" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" title=""></iframe><script src="https://create.twu.ca/h5p/wp-content/plugins/h5p/h5p-php-library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

*Sample 2: [Drag the Words](https://h5p.org/drag-the-words){target="_blank"}*

<iframe src="https://create.twu.ca/h5p/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=h5p_embed&id=55" width="789" height="1179" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" title=""></iframe><script src="https://create.twu.ca/h5p/wp-content/plugins/h5p/h5p-php-library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

*Sample 3: [Multiple Choice](https://h5p.org/multichoice){target="_blank"}*

<iframe src="https://create.twu.ca/h5p/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=h5p_embed&id=36" width="789" height="1179" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" title=""></iframe><script src="https://create.twu.ca/h5p/wp-content/plugins/h5p/h5p-php-library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

!! Note that H5P is an application in Moodle, so you can create your own quizzes and use it for graded assessments.


#### Graded Quizzes, Tests & Exams {.unnumbered}

For your graded assessments, there are some key questions to ask:

- What is the purpose of the assessment?
- Does it test the level of understanding that I need to assess?
- Are the instructions clear?
- What question types are effective to help students explain what they know (short answer, multiple choice, etc.)
- How easy will it be for students to look up the answers as they take the test?

We've provided some resources below that may help you address some of these questions. Considering the last one in particular, you may want to take the following measures as you design your assessment:

- Set a time limit.
- Have a question bank. Moodle can select from a number of questions and randomize the quiz numbers for each student.
- Craft your questions to include more higher-order thinking skills - requiring more application, rather than retrieving facts from their textbook.
- Remember, your usual in-class test could now be considered a take home test. Students will have all of their resources available to check. Perhaps encourage them to use them! The time limit will help focus students.
- And lastly...consider what could be assessed in a different assignment format (e.g. video essay, journal response, case study report).

### Case Studies, Simulations & Role Plays

Case studies, simulations, and role plays are a great methods to strengthen students' critical thinking skills, as they often need to analyze issues, solve problems, and make decisions. They can be especially effective as group assignments, perhaps allowing for some "disorienting dilemmas" that cause transformational learning.

Consider having your students write and analyze case studies for an assignment. Or better yet, contribute to [OPEN CASE STUDIES AT UBC](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/){target="_blank"}, an interdisciplinary, open educational resource with case studies that can be used by anyone.

### Essays, Projects, & Interviews

If you use essays, projects, and interviews in your courses, what are some techniques you use to aid students, or some common problems? What adjustments do you foresee for an online course?
Here are some questions to consider:

- What does the 'drafting stage' look like for these projects? Do you give formative feedback to students before they hand in their final project?
- What online tools can students use? (e.g. Google docs to collaborate, Zoom for presentations, etc.)
- How do I prevent cheating and plagiarism in student writing?

We're going to address a couple of these questions in our synchronous zoom sessions and later units. For now, check out the resources for some tips on these issues.


### Activity: Cheating in an Online Course

::: {.learning-activity}

Skim the following resources:

- [Strategies to Reduce Cheating in online courses](https://www.uregina.ca/cce/assets/docs/pdf/distance-online/instructional-design/strategies_to_reduce_cheating.pdf){target="_blank"}
- [Student Equity: Discouraging Cheating in Online Courses](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1057085.pdf){target="_blank"}

!! Now some of you might say, "Turnitin is a good tool to prevent cheating"...but this is definitely contested. In one of our Zoom sessions, we'll discuss this topic in detail and will post the video for asynchronous viewing. Stay tuned!

:::


### Video & Audio Assignments

How do you currently integrate technology/media into your assignments? Is there an opportunity for personalization or creativity in the way information is presented? Let's discuss utilizing media in your assignments, such as video and audio applications.

**Video Assessments**

Most students have access to a video recording device (their cell phones), so why not take advantage of that! Consider how you might use video assessments in your course. Students can record a video blog, give a presentation, show their field trip, demonstrate a procedure...the list goes on. Storytelling is a key feature of video assignments, so consider how students can connect the course content to their own personal or professional experience. Another way to use videos is for students to analyze videos online related to your course.

**Podcasts**
Podcasts can be another engaging alternative/addition to a typical essay, project, interview or presentation. See the following sample assignment from a Trinity course, as well as the resources in the learning activity below.

*Sample Podcast Activity/Assessment:*


### Activity

::: {.learning-activity}

In this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. Audio I and Audio II in the Digital Literacy section of the orientation will explain how to set up your podcast. You can find the link to the orientation [here.](https://create.twu.ca/orientation/#Digital_Literacy){target="_blank"}

If you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved.

:::


##### Instructions:

- Using one of the practical problems you identified from learning activity 8.1, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.
- Record that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.
- Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.
- Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.
- Your project idea should be clear and well organized.
- Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.
- Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.
- Upload your podcast to [soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com){target="_blank"}, [tapewrite.com](https://tapewrite.com){target="_blank"}, or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on the Unit 8 discussion forum.

**Reminder:** Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.

- Note this podcast is part of your assessment for this unit. See Unit 8 Assessment for more details.

### Images & Graphic Organizers

Images and graphic organizers can be powerful tools in many types of assignments. Just as we use visuals in our teaching for various reasons, students can include them in assignments to engage the reader, present complex information quickly and clearly, and communicate effectively.

In the resources below you'll see several digital tools that may be useful for you in your teaching, as well as for your students in their assignments. Be sure to give enough instructions and guidance when recommending a tool, and ensure the focus is on demonstrating the mastery of a course learning outcome (not the technology).

## Unit Overview

We typically start with an overview of what is in the unit - what are the key ideas, how does it connect to the rest of the course, why does this matter to students, etc. This is one way the instructor can connect to students, to set the stage for learning, and to really bring in your teacher's voice or presence. Many instructors use video to share the unit overview, as this can personalize the experience for students.

![](assets/u2/archery-2721785_640.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

The Unit Overview also includes the unit Topics, Learning Outcomes, Activities, and Resources. We include these details as it allows students to plan their week, make time for activities and assessments, ensure they have the required resources, and to know what the purpose is of the unit (learning outcomes).


### Topics {.unnumbered}

After giving a preview of the unit in the Overview section, we typically list the topics. Now, you may think that your unit/lesson is just one main topic, but consider if that can be broken down a bit more. A bit later we'll discuss why we "chunk" information, but for now as you think about a unit and fill out your course blueprint, try to break down your main topic into subtopics.


### Unit Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

Learning outcomes describe what learners will be able to *know, do and value* after a learning experience. They clearly explain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students will gain through a course.

It is crucial to have measurable learning outcomes listed on the course outline, as they communicate expectations to the learner and help guide the instructor. We also encourage instructors to list the learning outcomes for each unit/lesson, as again, this helps students know what to aim for.

*Writing SMART Learning Outcomes*

![](assets/u2/SMART-goals.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

The diagram above illustrates the five key principles in designing learning outcomes. They must be specific and clear, instructors must be able to measure successful completion of an outcome, and learners must be able to achieve them. Learning outcomes should also be relevant to the course and achievable within the time period allotted.

For more examples of learning outcomes, see our course text *[Teaching in a Digital Age](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/part/chapter-2-the-nature-of-knowledge-and-the-implications-for-teaching/){target="_blank"}* by Tony Bates.

[details="Want to know more about Learning Outcomes? Click to Open!"]

**Bloom's Taxonomy**

​Instructional designers often use Bloom's Taxonomy to help write learning outcomes. The graphics below lists possible verbs to use in a learning outcome, as well as examples of activities and/or assessments. Just to give one example, if you are assessing the domain of analysis by asking student to compare, you may ask them to create and administer a survey. As you write your outcomes, what **[Higher Order Thinking Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_thinking){target="_blank"} (HOTS)** are you promoting?

![](assets/u2/Blooms-taxonomy.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

For more, see [Revised Bloom's Taxonomy](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/){target="_blank"} from Iowa State University.

**Significant Learning**

Fink (2003) described learning as change in the learner. How can we tell what has changed in our students, or how the course has impacted them?
In his book, *Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing Colleges Courses*, he asks instructors to consider what students will take away from the course. What are the long-term goals? What will they remember?

The image here shows Fink's Taxonomy of Significant Learning. Consider the various categories of learning as you write your outcomes. Will students apply their learning? Learn about themselves or others? Value a new idea or perspective? Become a self-directed learner?
[![Fink Significant Learning](https://live.staticflickr.com/3172/2897475124_d578e30591.jpg)](https://flickr.com/photos/lauradahl/2897475124 "Fink Significant Learning")

**SOLO Taxonomy**

Another great resource that can help you write effective learning outcomes is the *Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO)* created by John Biggs and K. Colis. The images below show the 5 levels of understanding. As you write your outcomes, consider the increasing complexity of understanding students can demonstrate through assessments. How will they know what level they are at? Try to incorporate descriptions in a grading rubric that explain the connections you want students to make (e.g. analyze, compare, hypothesize, predict, etc.)

![](assets/u2/512px-Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_SOLO_Taxonomy.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

[/details]


### Activities and Assessments

In the Overview section we often have an Activity Checklist - some indication of what is required of students in the units. This could be a brief list of readings/videos, learning activities, and assessments.
*Sample Activity Checklist*
![](assets/u2/Activity-Checklist.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

We will dive more the topics of activities and assessments a bit later.


### Resource List

A final piece of information in the Unit Overview section is the resource list. We often list just the main resource (e.g. course text) and then let students know the rest of the resources will be linked within the unit. This allows students to plan for any texts/articles they must purchase. Listing the resources throughout the unit allows for scaffolding of learning, as well as a way to provide context and guiding questions for students, rather than a master list of resources.


### Activity: Writing Learning Outcomes

::: {.learning-activity}

Read section 12.8 [Step six: set appropriate learning goals](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-8-step-six-set-appropriate-learning-goals/){target="_blank"} in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.

Consider the question Bates asks:
- Take a course you are teaching in class at the moment. Write down the learning goals. Given the need for developing the skills needed in a digital age, would you want to change the goals of this course? If so, would you have to change your teaching methods and/or use of technology?

- In addition to the course learning outcomes listed in your syllabus, what are the unit learning outcomes? If you are planning out a course currently, consider taking the time to map out the lesson with these details in mind.

:::


## Unit Topics

After we've given an Overview to the students about what is in the lesson/unit, the next step is to teach the topics. But how do we do this online? Hold a 1-3 hour Zoom session? (*Often the answer is "NO!"*) The teaching techniques you use in the classroom do not necessarily transfer to online. So, what are effective methods for teaching content in an online course?


### Using PowerPoint Slideshows

When instructors are asked to put their course online, the default for many is to post the PowerPoints that they have created for their face-to-face classroom. The problem is...the online course is not face-to-face!! PowerPoint presentations were designed as a tool for when the speaker is *presenting*. If you simply put a 60 slide pwpt online for students to view - they are missing the teaching part!
Here are some ways to use PowerPoint presentations in your online course:

- **Add audio or video:** Please consider adding a voice to your slideshow, as the personal explanation of the slides is crucial for learning.
- **Shorten your presentations:** 60 slides is a lot of content to digest at one time. Consider chunking your presentations into smaller subtopics so students can organize their learning and pause for interaction (see next point).
- **Pause for interaction!** Add learning activities in the PowerPoints, such as posing questions for students to answer in their notes.
- And finally...**Don't use PowerPoint!** For an online course, you have the option of simply putting the "teaching content" from your PowerPoint right into the course (like I'm doing here). Please consider what pieces of the pwpt need to remain in slideshow format, and what can simply be in the text.


### Using Videos

Videos are a great way to teach in an online course - and there are a variety of ways to do this.

- Record your synchronous Zoom sessions. Our TOne course for example is doing this, for several reasons:
- It's a way to provide extra content to learners.
- It provides a record of the sessions so students can review.
- It allows students that were unable to attend the session to view the session at their own time.
- It builds community! Some of our sessions for example are simply for Q&A and are learner-directed. We hope this format facilitates a *Community of Inquiry* where faculty can collaborate and share ideas.

### Using Images & Graphic Organizers

![](assets/u2/girl-2848057_1920.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

Consider the images used in this website. Do they grab your attention? Make you reflect on prior learning experiences? Pique your interest?

Images can be powerful tools in your course design. As you write your units, explore various images and graphic organizers to engage students, and bring meaning to the text.

![](assets/u2/Graphic-Organizer.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

**Finding Images for Your Course**
Here are a couple of great search engines to find images. Please try to find free and open images – ones that have a Creative Commons license.

- [Pixabay](http://pixabay.com/){target="_blank"}
- [Google Advanced Search](http://www.google.com/advanced_image_search){target="_blank"}
- [Wikimedia Commons](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){target="_blank"}

- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/){target="_blank"}
- [Creative Commons](http://search.creativecommons.org/){target="_blank"}
- [Flickr Creative Commons](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons){target="_blank"}


### Activity: Tell a Story

::: {.learning-activity}

As a practice for writing about a topic in your course, try telling a story about it. Use your camera phone to record yourself, or simply write down your thoughts on paper. Explain the key concepts about a course topic - sharing what makes it interesting *for you!*

To help you get started, use a [Liberating Structure](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/ls-menu){target="_blank"} exercise (we'll talk more about LS in our activity section).

!!! Ask, "Why is this topic important?" Write down your answer. Then ask, "Why is that?" Keep asking, "Why? Why? Why?" up to nine times or you can go no deeper because you have reached the fundamental purpose for this topic.

:::


### Chunking Your Topics

We've mentioned chunking a couple times in this unit, but what does it really mean, and why is it important? Chunking "it "is the process of breaking down content into smaller, bite-sized bits of easily digestible information that are easy to comprehend, learn, and commit to memory" - [eLearningindustry.com](https://elearningindustry.com/content-chunking-engaging-course){target="_blank"}.
When we discussed the principles of accessibility earlier, this is a key idea. As you write your units and put your course online, consider the lesson flow, the pauses for interaction (learning activities), and how best to organize content to help students learn.


### Activity: Resources on Chunking

::: {.learning-activity}

Read section 12.3 [Step One: Decide how you want to teach](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-3-step-one-decide-how-you-want-to-teach/){target="_blank"} from our course text. In particular, pay attention to section 12.3.4 "What NOT to do" where Tony talks about chunking online work into manageable chunks.

Select from the following resources to learn more about chunking.

## Unit Learning Activities and Assessments

In week two of our course, we will explore learning activities and assessments in detail, but for now, let's talk about one key concept: making connections between learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.
![](assets/u2/oaa.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

Look at the learning outcomes of one of your lessons/units. How will students demonstrate their learning? The answer is often through assessment of some kind. But how do we prepare learners for the assessment? This is where the **learning activities** come in.
Here are some of the learning activities we've had in this course so far:

- reading resources, watching videos, exploring websites
- taking a quiz
- making a T-chart graphic organizer
- filming a videos
- writing about a topic
- answering questions
- posting in a Discussion Forum
- attending a synchronous Zoom session

All of these learning activities are designed to help you think more deeply about the topics presented. They are ungraded (as should most activities be for your students) and optional. This presents a very low-stakes engagement option for students.

The trick with most online courses is motivating the students to actually do these non-graded activities.

One key way is to emphasize how the activities will help students succeed in their assessments. If for example, they have to analyze a case study in a major assignment, then they should be able to practice the skills needed to do this. If students are giving a presentation, ask students to record themselves practicing their presentation (better yet, to practice in front of peers).

There are several engaging learning activities and assessments that we will discuss next week. For now, consider whether there are clear connections between the outcomes, activities, and assessments in your course.


### Activity: Learning Activities

::: {.learning-activity}

Read section 12.9.10 [Designing student activities](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-9-step-seven/){target="_blank"} in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.

Read *50 CATs by Angelo and Cross* on our [Online OnRamp site](http://create.twu.ca/help/online-learning-on-ramp/finishing-well/50-cats){target="_blank"}

*Questions to Consider*

- What ungraded learning activities have worked well in your classes?

:::


### Instructional Design Models

There are several key models that influence the way we design online courses. Two that we'll focus on are the ADDIE model and Backwards Design.

The **ADDIE Process** illustrates 5 phases of course development:
![alt-text](assets/u2/Skema_ADDIE.jpg "ADDIE model"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}
*Source: [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skema_ADDIE.jpg){target="_blank"}*

**Backwards Design** (Fink, 2003; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) is where we first focus on the *target*: what knowledge, skills or attitudes do we want students to have at the end of the course? Second, how will they *demonstrate* this? Finally, what learning *experiences* will help students achieve this?


### Activity: Instructional Design Models

::: {.learning-activity}

Read section 4.3 [The ADDIE model](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/6-5-the-addie-model/){target="_blank"} in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.

### Course Design Process at TWU

Every course is different, and every course design experience is different. In this section we'd like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.

*Please note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.*

Our Instructional Design team at TWU generally follows the following development process:
![alt-text](assets/u2/Course-Design-Process-at-TWU-1.jpg "Pre-planning"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}
![alt-text](assets/u2/Course-Design-Process-at-TWU-2.jpg "Planning"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}
![alt-text](assets/u2/Course-Design-Process-at-TWU-3.jpg "Writing"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

![alt-text](assets/u2/Course-Design-Process-at-TWU-5.jpg "Production"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}


#### Creating a Course Blueprint {.unnumbered}

The most important part of course design is the planning. After the initial stages of needs analysis (what do the students/instructors need) and hiring phase (who will write the course), the development teach creates a plan, or a blueprint of the course.

In developing this document we focus on the development of learning outcomes that are measurable, and then ensure that the supporting activities and assessments are mapped directly to these outcomes.

Below are some examples of part of a blueprint document. For a current blueprint template for TWU courses, click on the following links: [TWU Course Blueprint Template - Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJ27S2OeEW01JFpICjWtvsYLj1a0SpD9dy7yoX8ttAQ/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}; [TWU Course Blueprint Template - Word version](assets/u2/TWU-Course-Blueprint-Template.docx){target="_blank"}

![alt-text](assets/u2/ldrs-627-blueprint.png "LDRS 627 Blueprint"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

![alt-text](assets/u2/phil-210-blueprint.png "PHIL 210 Blueprint"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

!!! Note in the blueprint that there is a table for 10 units. This does not apply to all courses!! If you happen to work with an Instructional Designer in planning out your course, a key question will be how to organize the learning/content. This may work out to be 10 key units for a 12 week course, but each course is different.


### Activity: Starting a Course Blueprint

::: {.learning-activity}

Read section 12.9 [Step seven: design course structure and learning activities](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-9-step-seven/){target="_blank"} from our course text.

Take a couple minutes to download the TWU course blueprint template (Google doc or Word version). Start mapping out a course you need to plan. Even if it's just to add the course description and course learning outcomes - it's a start! This blueprint process usually takes some time and contemplation, especially figuring out the unit learning outcomes and resources.

Let's move on to the next topic, where will address the next steps in the process, including creating content, activities and assessments.

Nice work!

The internet is full of serendipitous surprises, and you should take advantage of that. Use links in your course materials to extend understanding, provide context, and promote curiosity.

If you have an image you'd like to share, send me a link at [safe-email autolink="true"]colin.madland@twu.ca[/safe-email] and I'll add it as a header to one of our pages, along with credit, of course.

# Welcome to Unit 4! {.unnumbered}

You have likely noticed by now that this unit looks a bit different from the previous three units, and that is by design. Our intent in shifting to a different format is to show you different formats and course structures in multi-access learning environments.

The remaining units will demonstrate one way to reduce your reliance on web-conferencing (Zoom, BlueJeans, Skype...) when providing direct instruction for learners in your course. As we have all experienced as we finished the Spring 2020 semester, web-conferencing is exhausting! It is not a good replacement for a lecture, it is difficult for instructors, and it is difficult for learners. For some learners (and instructors), it is impossible due to sketchy or limited bandwidth internet connections at home, or to extreme differences in time-zones.

Web-conferencing certainly helped get us through March and April, so this is not to denigrate those who needed it, but it is important to recognize that March and April 2020 in higher ed were far less than ideal.

So for this week, we are going to focus on a primarily asynchronous, low-bandwidth mode of communication supplemented with more casual and unstructured synchronous meetings.

Below this post, you will see what is called a 'feed' which is essentially a subscription to a blog. Each time I publish a post (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings), that post will show up at the top of the feed. Each post will outline some new content and resources for that topic. You will also notice posts from the Library and other faculty at TWU.

Although I am using a blog to keep you all up-to-date, you can do the same thing with a list of emails.

!!!! If you have your own blog and would like to respond to the reflection prompts for this week on your own blog, send me the URL and I will create another feed of participant posts.

There are a wide variety of possible learning environments in both F2F and online contexts. You might be familiar with Ferris Bueller's economics teacher in the 1986 movie *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*.

Or, perhaps, you are familiar with this scene from the 1950s, which might be analogous to some teachers who simply throw everything at their learners in a way that is far too fast for their learners to process. Some people also call this method 'drinking from a fire hose'.

### Predicting school in Y2K.

Or, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France predicting what school would look like in the year 2000. Perhaps Cote was only off by about 20 years in his prediction!

### University in 1350

Perhaps you recognize this scene depicting a university lecture in 1350 in Bologna.

I hope it is obvious to you that not all teaching and learning environments are actually conducive to learning or to building a community. Whether a teacher is putting their learners to sleep, or forcing too much content, or trying to rely on a techno-magical solution, there are problems with all of the learning environments shown above.

Here is my bold and provocative statement for this post...

! Face-to-face interaction, whether mediated through the web or not, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development and growth of transformative communities of inquiry.

## Key Questions

- ...[what do YOU want to know?]
- Are you a digital resident or visitor?
- How can technology help us start with community and relationship vs. content and mastery.


## Provocation

Digital literacy has almost nothing to do with age and the idea of 'digital natives' (younger people being able to use technology more easily because they grew up with it) is the wrong way to think about digital literacy.


### Activity:

::: {.learning-activity}

Here is a short survey you can use to understand your learners' contexts and access to web tools.

[details="Click to open"]
[Online Learning Readiness Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/73HZ3GS)



[/details]

It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

===

The essential argument is that *kids these days* have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

[Digital native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native)



Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to create a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.

### Residents and Visitors

I'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where *you* reside, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or maybe it's a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else's blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor <--> resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal <--> professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).

Take some time to engage in the following activity.


### Activity:

::: {.learning-activity}

I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?

[details="Click to open"]
 Read [ Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171){target="_blank"}
 Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice.
 Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a tool that falls into the 'Professional-Resident' quadrant for you and send me the link so I can add it to a feed. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others' diagrams!
 Alternately, you can share a link in the Unit 4 Discussion forum.

- Box 8-1 (Affordances of technology)
- how would you rank the importance or relevance of each of the 8 affordances listed? What other affordances can you see in technology in education?

In order to build a Community of Reflection and Practice (the TOnE CORP), we encourage you to connect with someone who can provide support. Here is a structure we will use in this course and which you are encouraged to replicate in your own courses.

:::


#### Learning Partners {.unnumbered}

Each learner should identify one learning partner who will be their first contact when they have a question about the `logistics` of the course and expectations from the instructor. Your learning partner will be your 'go-to' person for all sorts of questions about due dates, assignment instructions, procedures, where to find resources, etc.


#### Learning Pods {.unnumbered}

Each set of learning partners will also connect with another set of learning partners to form a learning pod. Learning pods should meet regularly outside of our scheduled meeting times to discuss the course `content`. This is an opportunity for peer review of your individual work, questions about difficult concepts, and other content-related items.


#### Rationale {.unnumbered}

One of the common complaints about remote learning is that both learners and faculty feel very isolated and alone. It is important to provide some structure to encourage learner-learner interactions. Faculty who have used this strategy report that comments show up in end of course 'evaluations' that learners, for the first time in their degree, made a friend because of this course structure. Social connections are critical for many learners. Furthermore, encouraging learners to review each others' work is a cognitive task that encourages deep approaches to learning.
