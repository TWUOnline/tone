    "text": "3.1 What is Multi-Access Learning?\nOnline learning, blended, flipped, face-to-face, hybrid, multi-access… you may have heard some of these terms tossed around, especially recently with the shifting focus to online. Before we unpack and examine these modalities of learning, consider how learning in Higher Education has changed. Not just recently with the impact of COVID-19, but the shifts that have happened in the last 20, 10, 5 years. How has technology shaped the way you teach and the way your students learn?\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Reflecting on Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkim Chapter 1: Fundamental Change in Education of our core text, Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates. See in particular sections 1.6-1.8.\nQuestions to Consider: - What changes have you seen in Online Learning? - What does “online” look like at TWU? - What changes to you foresee in the next few years and how does this affect you, your course, and your students?\nOne trend that is gaining traction is Multi-Access Learning. Read the following excerpt from Realigning Higher Education for the 21st-Century Learner through Multi-Access Learning by Irvine, Code & Richards (2013).\n! “Multi-access learning is an opportunity to meet both student needs for access to learning experiences and faculty needs for graduate student recruitment (Irvine, 2009; Irvine & Code, 2011, 2012; Irvine & Richards, 2013). Irvine defines multi-access learning as a framework for enabling students in both face-to-face and online contexts to personalize learning experiences while engaging as a part of the same course. Multi-access learning is different than blended learning because it places the student at the center of the learning experience as opposed to the instructor or the institution.\n! Further, “blended learning” is a problematic term due to its multiple interpretations in the literature and in daily practice, leaving one to ask, “Who controls the blend?” When and where the face-to-face sessions occur and when and how the online synchronous or asynchronous sessions occur are often controlled in blended learning settings. At the core, the institution or instructor is in control of the blend, no matter the configuration.\n! Multi-access learning, however, has the learner at the center, with the ability to choose how he/she wants to access the course. The core principle of the multi-access framework is one of enabling student choice in terms of the combination of course delivery methods through which the learning environment is accessed; that is, each individual learner decides how he/she wishes to take the course (e.g., face-to-face or online) and can then participate with other students and the instructor – each of whom have their own modality preferences – at the same time” (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).\n\nSource: Tiers of the multi-access framework (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).\nWith the uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, multi-access learning has great potential for our education system. This modality not only brings more choice to students, but promotes a learner-centred course design and best practices in teaching and learning.\n[details=“Read more about the 4 tiers of multi-access learning.”]\n\n\n\n3.1.1.0.1 Tier 1\nThe first tier of multi-access learning is what most of you have experienced (as learners and faculty) as the predominant modality of higher education, face-to-face (f2f). F2f learning environments are often assumed to be the preferred modality of learning because a f2f classroom allows for rich, multi-modal interactions and robust community-building. This is true to an extent, but only if class sizes are very small; large, lecture-based classrooms present significant challenges to building the kind of critical and safe community for engaged interaction.\n\n\n3.1.1.0.2 Tier 2\nThe second tier of access allows learners who cannot travel to a central campus (like during a worldwide pandemic) to participate in a learning community syncronously via video conferencing. Remote and local learners may exchange items and artifacts and may share video feeds and use software such as Etherpad or screensharing through the web-conferencing tool to collaborate on documents for co-creation of content.\n\n\n3.1.1.0.3 Tier 3\nThe third tier provides asynchronous access for remote learners who cannot join the scheduled class session due to any number of constraints (employment, child/elder care, time-zone, or even network bandwidth). Irvine, et al. acknowledge that simply viewing a recording of a synchronous session, regardless of how collaborative and engaging that session may have been, is a much leaner experience for learners and may not be optimal. This highlights the need to provide learning materials in formats beyond video and audio, perhaps including text-based materials and asynchronous tools for co-creation of content such as GitHub.\n\n\n3.1.1.0.4 Tier 4\nThe outermost tier of the model is for open participation from non-credit learners who are choosing to participate for their own interest and edification. It may seem anathema to some faculty to consider opening their course to the world, but the benefits can be significant, particularly in times like the spring of 2020.\n!!!! This course is designed to take advantage of all four tiers of the multi-access model (except f2f for now…). Anyone is welcome to follow along at multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020.\n[/details]\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Activity: What do you know about Multi-Access Learning?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a close look at the following image. (Click to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blended - Multi-access learning, great spotlight #tiegrad talk by (_valeriei?) at #CanEdu14 flickr photo by giulia.forsythe shared into the public domain using Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0)\nNext, read Realigning Higher Education for the 21st-Century Learner through Multi-Access Learning by Irvine, Code and Richards (2013).\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat ideas surround multi-access learning, according to the image?\nWhat is your definition of multi-access learning?\nIf you were asked to provide multi-access learning for your course, what initial questions would you have?\n\nSo how does this Multi-Access model of learning compare to what you have experienced as an instructor? You may teach online, on campus, or have a blended approach in your courses. What are the key differences between these approaches and modalities?\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Activity: Key Terms and Modalities in Online Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 10: Modes of delivery of our course text, Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates.\nNext, take the following quiz to test your understanding of the modalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Activity: Resources in Online Models of learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about online models of learning, feel free browse through the following resources;\n\n\n\n\nThe Flipped Classroom: An Opportunity to Engage Millennials…\nFlipping the Classroom\nBlended Learning and Flipped Classrooms\nBlended Learning Activities from Linfield College. Compares face-to-face approach to online activities, including emailing assignments and feedback, student video presentations, online quizzes and discussions.\nBlended and Online Learning from Vanderbilt University. Tips include: know your learner, present a clear path through the material, promote metacognitive awareness, maintain a social presence, promote collaboration, promote active learning, and incorporate media.\n\n!!!

Simon Fraser University (2010) has defined experiential learning as:\n! “the strategic, active engagement of students in opportunities to learn through doing, and reflection on those activities, which empowers them to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical endeavours in a multitude of settings inside and outside of the classroom.”\nThe Experiential Learning model was developed in the 70’s by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.\n\nSource: The four steps in Kolb cycle. From Experiential Learning Theories by David Kolb. Wikipedia\nOther key models related to experiential learning are:\n\nactive learning,\ninquiry-based learning,\nproblem-based learning, and\ncollaborative learning.\n\nIn our condensed course, we won’t examine these models in depth (unfortunately!), but please see the resources listed in the learning activity below.\n\n\n3.4.2 Activity: Philosophy, Principles and Practices of Teaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkim Engaging Adult Learners: Philosophy, Principles and Practices by Jim Bryson\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\nHere are other optional resources to browse on design principles.\n\nVideo: 8 things to know about the experiential learning cycle\nKolb’s Learning Styles and Experiential Learning Cycle\nBest Practices: Active Learning\nExamples of Experiential Education at Carleton - Experiential Education\nInquiry-Based Learning | Centre for Teaching and Learning\nInquiry-based learning in higher education: Principal forms, educational objectives, and disciplinary variations\nAn Overview Of Cooperative Learning\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat principles and practices resonate with you?\nHow do these influence your course design?\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Activity: Methods of Teaching (Online & F2F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve had a very quick overview of some key design principles, how does this relate to online and face-to-face classrooms?\nRead Chapter 3: Methods of teaching: campus-focused and Chapter 4: Methods of teaching with an online focus.\nCreate a T-chart, comparing the campus class to the online class.\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Class\nOnline Class\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nIs there overlap between the modalities?\nCould you anticipate any problems with trying to use classroom models of teaching in online environments?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Learning should be ACCESSIBLE\nWe talked a bit about multi-access in the previous topic, but I want to focus on the barriers that might prevent students from learning.\n\nunpredictable internet access\nconfusing technology (pwpt, Moodle, etc.)\nlack of motivation\nlack of support\ndifficult navigation in course (e.g. hard to find assessment info, dropboxes, etc.)\nlanguage/cultural barriers\n\nWhat other concerns have you heard from students, or that you have felt yourself as you encounter a new learning tool?\nAs we design our courses, we want to incorporate inclusive learning, or principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 defines this approach to curriculum and teaching:\n! “The term ‘universal design for learning’ means a scientifically valid framework for guiding educational practice that– ! provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in the ways students respond or demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are engaged; and ! reduces barriers in instruction, provides appropriate accommodations, supports, and challenges, and maintains high achievement expectations for all students, including students with disabilities and students who are limited English proficient” (110th Congress, 2008).\nIn the learning activity below, there are several resources on Universal Design for Learning. Before you scan those, take a look at the following graphic organizer and consider the steps you can take to design your courses for all learners.\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Activity: Inclusive Design Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Universal Design for Learning Overview from Iowa State University.\nView Inclusive and Accessible Tips for Designing a Course Online\nAlso see Cultural Competence Continuum - Characteristics from Cross (2001).\nFor more best practices in accessibility and inclusive design, select from the following:\n\nUniversal Design – Accessibility Toolkit\nUniversal Design - Best Practices for Online Learning\nFive competencies for culturally competent teaching and learning from Irish, & Scrubb (2012).\nBest Practices for Teaching & Learning Online\nCreating Conditions for (International) Student Success\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow do you design your course with accessibility in mind?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Learning should be TRANSFORMATIONAL\nWow!

    "section": "4.1 Purpose of Assessment",
    "text": "4.1 Purpose of Assessment\nThink about why assessment is a part of your course. How does it benefit you and your learners?\nAssessment demonstrates whether, and to what degree, the learner has met the learning outcomes for the course. It often lets the instructor know what concepts students struggle with which informs their teaching. Assessments traditionally come in the form of tests or essays, but there are a number of other ways we can measure students’ understanding. First, let’s focus on what assessment is.\n\n4.1.1 Understanding Assessment: Formative & Summative\nAssessment can be for, of, and as learning.\n\n! Assessment for Learning, a type of formative assessment, is utilized by teachers in order to gain an understanding of their students’ knowledge and skills in order to guide instruction.\n!!!! Assessment of Learning is a summative assessment used primarily to compare students and report progress.\n!!! Assessment as learning is also a formative assessment which focuses on teaching students the metacognitive processes to evaluate their own learning and make adjustments.\nSource: UBC’s Assessment as Learning\nIn our courses, we often think first of the summative assessments – the final test, unit quiz, essay, etc. that sums of students’ knowledge. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their learning of the course and we give them a final grade.\nFormative assessments involve giving feedback and helping students learn from the assessment. This ‘forms’ students knowledge so they can further show their understanding of a topic. For example, practice quizzes before a final exam, peer reviews of an essay before the final paper, reflective journals, 1 minute papers, muddiest point, etc., There are numerous effective formative activities to help students and instructors assess learning before being graded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummative Assessment\nFormative Assessment\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nAt the end of a learning activity\nDuring a learning activity\n\n\nGoal\nTo make a decision\nTo improve learning\n\n\nFeedback\nFinal judgement\nReturn to material\n\n\nFrame of Reference\nSometimes normative (comparing each student against all others); sometimes criterion\nAlways criterion (evaluating students according to the same criteria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable from Wikipedia citing Charting your course: How to prepare to teach more effectively, Atwood, 2000.\n\n\n4.1.2 Alignment in Course Design\nSo how do we choose formative and summative assessemnts for our course? An important part of course design is checking that there is alignment between assessments and learning outcomes. If your learning outcome asks students to compare two theories, for example, how do they show you they can do that? Often instructors will have their assessments in mind before they write their learning outcomes. Whatever process you have, make sure that your course learning outcomes are assessed in your assignments. Try to include these connections in your syllabus, as in the example below: \n\n\n4.1.3 Promoting Experiential Learning, Accessibility & Transformation\nLet’s refer back to Unit 1 and our key ideas that Learning should be an Experience, it should be Accessible, and it should be Transformational. Do your learning activities and assessments promote these principles?\nIn Engaging Adult Learners: Philosophy, Principles and Practices, Jim Bryson suggest 5 questions to ask yourself when choosing activities/assessments:\n! 1. Are the instructions, the purpose and the intended learning outcome(s) for this activity clear enough to be correctly understood by all students? ! 1. Is this activity fair? Will all students be able to understand and participate in it as a learning exercise? What choices do they have? Is it related to course content and laid out in a logical manner? ! 1. Will this activity add to my students’ interest in content? Will they find it engaging and motivating? Will it stimulate curiosity and participation? ! 1. Is this activity relevant to the intended learning outcomes for the course? Is it relevant to student expectations? To my instructional goals? ! 1. Have I provided support for success in terms of information, curriculum content, discussion, interaction, activities and available resources?\nAs you decide what activities/assessments are appropriate for your course, refer back to these questions.\nNext, consider the following quote: !! ‘Can transformative learning theory be put into practice, and if yes, what are some of the differences it makes to the lives of learners?’… !! ‘Can disorienting dilemmas be triggered by carefully designed exercises, and, if yes, what are the effects on student transformative learning?’ !! From Putting transformative learning theory into practice.\nHow do we carfeully design exercises (activities & assessments) that transform learners? How do we give them opportunities to explore and challenge their thinking?\nWatch the following video about Trinity’s Inquiry-Based Learning approach.\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider:\nBefore you move on to the learning activity, take a moment to jot down your thoughts on these questions:\n\nWhy do we assess?\nHow do I assess my students?\nAre there opportunities for students to practice what they are learning before an assessment?\nDo I give formative feedback that will help students be more successful in future assignments?\nHow do I design learning experiences that facilitate discovery, exploration, questioning, transformation, etc.?\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Activity: Assessment of Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 6.8 Assessment of learning from our course text.\nNext, select from the following resources:\n\nLearner Assessment in Online Courses: Best Practices & More\nThe Messy and Unpredictable Classroom\nAssessing Student Learning Online\nBest Practices: Alternative Assessments\nGuiding Principles for Assessment of Students’ Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Activity & Assessment Ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis topic is all about exploration and sharing. We’ll present a number of engaging learning activities with a range of purposes:\n\nFirst and foremost, the learning activity must align with your course/unit learning outcomes.\nActivities should also connect to assessments, allowing learners to practice and prepare for assignments.\nIn addition to your listed learning outcomes, there may be other skills the activities promote, including: collaboration, critical and creative thinking, quantitative and qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information literacy. (See TWU’s Student Learning Outcomes.)\n\nAs you explore the ideas and the links provided in this unit, you are encouraged to add your comments, ideas, experiences to our shared chalkboard (see chart below or click here for Padlet).

    "text": "4.2 Grading Rubrics & Peer Assessment\n\n4.2.1 Grading with Rubrics\nWhen giving students an assignment, it is crucial to explain to them exactly what you’re looking for and how you will assess their work. A rubric is one tool that can be used to authentically assess learners. It contains the list of criteria that highlights the what the learner is expected to do or demonstrate. Along with the criteria, a rubric provides examples of what is expected at each level of performance, from poor to excellent. Providing this criteria up front to learners allows them to assess their progress and compare to a performance level.\nBelow are some examples of rubric use in our online courses.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice the last two in particular have a detailed range of “Needs Improvement” to “Exceeds Expectations”. If possible, try to work out the details of what you’re looking for at each level of mastery. This helps not only when you’re grading students’ work, but also when you need to explain the grade you gave.\n\n\n4.2.2 Peer Feedback\nOne last important topic to cover in our assessment unit is about the value of peer feedback. Peer assessment can:\n\nimprove student work/performance\noffer timely feedback\nreduce grading workload\nhelp make your grading criteria more clear (as students use it to evaluate their peers)\nallow for critical reflection (of students’ own work & their peers)\n\nTo this last point, consider as well asking students to self-evaluate their work, acknowledging feedback from peers and/or the instructor and setting goals for improvement.\n\n\n4.2.3 Activity: Rubrics & Peer Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nGrading Rubrics\n\nGrading with Rubrics\nWhat is a rubric?\nBest Practices for Designing Effective Rubrics\nGuidelines for Building Marking Rubrics\nCreating and Using Rubrics\n\nPeer Feedback\n\nBest Practices: Peer Assessment\nIdeas and Strategies for Peer Assessments\nPeer Assessment\nGuide to Peer-Assessment\nPeer Assessment Resource Document\n\n!!!!

    "text": "5.1 Course Design Process\nImagine you win the lottery and have a couple million dollars to design your dream house. What would it look like? Where would it be? Who would live in it with you?\nIf you actually had to do the work to map out the blueprint of your house, what are the components? What is the layout and design? What motivates you to make those design choices?\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a course is like planning, building, and moving into a house. You start with asking some key questions:\n\nWhat is the course? What are the ’big picture‘ ideas, or the main take-aways?\nHow does this course fit in with the program?\nIf a previous course exists, has there been any feedback from students and instructors? …and the most important questions:\nWho are the students? What is the typical age, gender, work experience, culture, etc.? What are their interests, learning styles, and needs?​\n\nAnother strategy to use before getting into the details of a course is identifying the Big Ideas (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Below is an image from Stanford University (adapted) that takes us through the process of deciding the big ideas, essential questions, key knowledge and skills, and learning activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Activity: What’s Your Metaphor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get into more of the design process and models, what’s your metaphor for designing a course? Does it seem like an impromptu marathon that is sprung on you, or a paced cooking experience where you can get creative with your own recipe? How about following the “easy” directions in assembling a child’s toy?\nWhatever your guiding metaphor is, consider your first steps. What are the big ideas of your course? What are the needs of your students?\nAs we move forward in course planning, select a course you’d like to focus on in these three weeks we have together. What are your key needs as we map out your course?\nIn the next sections, we’ll have a closer look at the design models that influence us, as well as the course design process at TWU.",

    "section": "5.3 Ensuring Quality in Online Learning Design",
    "text": "5.3 Ensuring Quality in Online Learning Design\nWhat is a quality online course? Take a moment to jot down some thoughts.\nWhen we assess the quality of an online course, many course designers turn to the Quality Matters rubric for Higher Education. Have a quick look at the link and we’ll expand on the elements in a bit. As you skim the sections, pay attention to the key feature of alignment.\n! “Unique to the QM Rubric is the concept of Alignment. This occurs when critical course components — Learning Objectives (Competencies) (2.1, 2.2), Assessment and Measurement (3.1), Instructional Materials (4.1), Learning Activities and Learner Interaction (5.1), and Course Technology (6.1) — work together to ensure students achieve desired learning outcomes.” - From QM Course Design Rubric Standards.\nAt TWU, we have slightly modified the rubric to align with our own Trinity standards of values for teaching and learning.\nAs you read the following guidelines, consider how you can incorporate them into your course design.\n\n5.3.1 #1: Course Overview and Introduction\n• Instructions are clear on how to navigate the course and how to get started.\n• The Course Overview provides a course description, learning outcomes, and list of assessments.\n• There is a self-introduction by the instructor, welcoming students to the course and explaining key aspects of what to expect in the course.\n• Learners are asked to introduce themselves to the class.\n\n\n5.3.2 #2: Learning Outcomes\n• The course learning outcomes are measurable and reflect the course description and level of the course.\n• The module/unit learning outcomes are measurable and consistent with the course-level outcomes.\n• The learning outcomes are stated clearly and written from the learner’s perspective.\n• There is a clear relationship between the course/unit learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.\n\n\n5.3.3 #3: Assessment\n• The assessments measure the achievement of the course learning outcomes and are consistent with course activities and resources.\n• Specific and descriptive criteria (rubrics, marking schemes) are provided for the evaluation of students’ work and participation.\n• The assessments are sequenced, varied, flexible, and appropriate to the content being assessed.\n• Sufficient and varied opportunities for formative feedback are provided.\n• The learner workload is appropriate and reasonable for the level and number of credits for the course.\n\n\n5.3.4 #4: Instructional Materials\n• The instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.\n• Course materials and resources are up-to-date, relevant, and appropriate for the level of the course.\n• The instructional materials are free of bias, culturally inclusive, and provide flexibility and choice.\n• A variety of instructional materials are used in the course.\n\n\n5.3.5 #5: Learning Activities and Learner Interaction\n• Learning activities support learners in achieving the learning outcomes and completing assessments. • Learning activities provide scaffolding opportunities for building foundational knowledge and skills within the course.\n• Learning activities foster student-instructor, student-content, and if appropriate to the course, student-student interaction.\n• The requirements for learner interaction are clearly stated.\n\n\n5.3.6 #6: Course Technology\n• The technology used in the course support the learning outcomes, activities and assessments.\n• Tools promote student engagement and active learning.\n• Students are instructed on how to protect their data and privacy.\n• All third-party materials are identified, cited and permission requested if necessary.\n• A variety of technology is used in the course.\n\n\n5.3.7 #7: Learner Support\n• Instructions for accessing support (instructor, IT, library, student services), are clearly stated in the course overview and when appropriate, throughout the course.\n• Instructors provide support for students throughout the course (e.g. though emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing, and other updates).\n• Learners are able to participate in a peer support forum (e.g. Learning Café), for course-related questions or community-building activities.\n\n\n5.3.8 #8: Accessibility and Usability\n• The course navigation facilitates ease of use.\n• The overall course is structured in a logical, consistent, sequenced, and efficient manner.\n• Instructions are clear, include rationale for activities and assessments, and provide seamless connections between the various elements in the course.\n• The course provides accessible text, videos and images for diverse learners.\n\n\n5.3.9 #9: TWU Values and Standards\n• Learner interaction (student-instructor, student-student, student-content) promotes a sense of community aligned with Trinity Western University core values.\n• Course design and instructional materials meet academic standards for Higher Education (online) learning.\n\n\n5.3.10 Activity: Quality Check for Online Courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nQM Course Design Rubric Standards\nQuality Matters rubric for Higher Education.\nOnline Course Design Best Practices Checklists\nBest Practices in Designing Online Courses\n\nNext, download our TWU Quality Checklist for Online Courses. pdf version; word version\nConsider using these guidelines as you develop your online course. !!! Note that this is a process! For the quick development of your summer sessions, it may not be possible to work on all elements. Let our design team know if we can help!",

Those students who may sit in your class, read their texts, hand in assignments, but aren’t really engaged in their learning? Imagine now a more self-directed online course, where those same students get to choose whether to study the resources presented; they choose whether to listen to your video lectures, engage in online discussion forums, complete ungraded learning activities…how do you motivate these students to become ACTIVE learners?\nOne strategy that helps students become not only active learners, but reflective learners, is to promote Reflective Learning. This can be a part of several assignment types, but for now, let’s focus on Reflective Journals. This type of assignment can be structured with specific questions (related to the learning outcomes), or unstructured, allowing the learner to explore and reflect in their own way.\n\nUngraded Reflective Journals\nReflective Journals are common graded assignments, but they can also be used as ungraded learning activities to promote note-taking, reflection, critical thinking, etc.\nFor example, in some of our online courses we often have this note for students when we explain the ungraded learning activities in a unit:\n!! Note that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. You are strongly encouraged to complete them, as they are designed to help you succeed in your course assessments. You are encouraged to write your responses in a Reflective Learning Journal and refer back to your notes as you complete your assignments.\nMake the connection to assessment explicit as you encourage learners to engage in the activity, write their notes in a journal, and study these notes to prepare for assignments.\n\n\nGraded Reflective Journals\nAs a graded assignment, consider allowing students some flexibility in how they present their learning process.\nHere are some sample instructions we use in our online courses:\nSample 1: Introduction to the Reflective Journal !!!! A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. !!!! The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. !!!! Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.\nSample 2: Journal Instructions !!! Note that for this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your assignments. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, and apply to other contexts.\n!!! As you read and watch the resources in this unit, consider the following questions: !!! 1. In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a transformational leader. !!! 1. Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context. !!! 1. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and assignments. !!! As you prepare your assignments, refer to these notes.\nSample 3: Journal Instructions ! Answer the following questions in your Reflective Journal: ! 1. What terms were the most important concepts of this week’s lesson? Be sure to define any important terms in your own words. (2 paragraphs) ! 2. What was your muddiest point (that is, what did not make sense)? (1 paragraph). ! 3. What would you like to know more about from this lesson, and why? (1 paragraph) ! 4. How does this lesson relate to something you have already learned outside of this class? (1 paragraph) ! 5. Why do you think you were required to learn this content? (1 paragraph)\nFor more samples of journals used on TWU online courses, see the following Google doc.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Activity: Resources on Reflective Journals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\n\n\n5.4.2.0.1 Reflective Journals\n\n\n\n\nAssignment Type: Reflective Journals\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Discussions & Blogs\n\nDiscussions Forums\nDiscussion forums are a popular form of assessment for online courses. Which means, if students are taking several online courses at once…there is a certain amount of forum fatigue they may experience! Be sure to craft your discussion questions in a way that meets the unit learning outcomes, but also inspires collaboration, inquiry, and critical thinking.\nIn the activity below there are several resources and guides for facilitating discussions. In particular, pay attention to the various activity types you can have in discussion forums. For example:\n\nWeb Field Trips: Instructor provides a link or a series of links. Students follow the link(s) and report back through an instructor-defined set of questions.\nBrainstorming: Students set forth a series of ideas on a given topic without evaluation.\nProblem-Solving: Small groups work out a solution to a problem.\nWriting Groups: Students work together in groups of four or five to share drafts and provide peer response and peer-editing.\nCase Analysis: Students work independent on a common case followed by group analysis in the board.\nCollaborative Writing: Workgroups work together to create a single document – proposals and analytical reports work well – which they then post to the larger group for critique.\nCooperative Debate: Workgroups present perspectives on a particular issue, followed by a whole group consensus-building discussion.\nDiscussions of Course Readings: Instructor creates threaded discussions around assigned readings. Threads may include pre-reading (anticipation) activities, interpretations, evaluations, etc.\nResearch Bank: Students and instructor contribute links and citations to a common area for a classwide research topic.\n\nSource: Generating and Facilitating Engaging and Effective Online Discussions\nFor samples of discussion instructions, see the Journals & Discussions Google doc.\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Activity: Resources on Discussion Forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nGenerating and Facilitating Engaging and Effective Online Discussions\nCollaborative Online Learning: Fostering Effective Discussions\nDiscussion Boards: Valuable? Overused? Discuss.\n\nConsider now the differences between a Discussion Forum and a Blog. What is the purpose? What can learners do/share with either activity? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\nCreate a T-chart, comparing the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\nBlog\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogs\n\nBLOGS for Collaborative Learning & Peer Review, (calanthaelsby?) #tli2012 flickr photo by giulia.forsythe shared into the public domain using Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0)\nAnother reflective learning tool is a blog. It may take some courage for some students to post their thoughts online (and for faculty to step out of Moodle), but it can be very effective in helping students demonstrate their learning.\nIt’s important to let students know that blogs can be kept private. Students can share their link with their instructor, or post their link on Moodle so other students can see. It’s important to go over privacy considerations with students, as well as netiquette guidelines\nHere are some benefits to consider from How Do Blogs Support Learning?\n\nBlogs help grow learning communities by allowing students to share their own perspectives and experiences while learning about those of their classmates.\nBlogs let students take ownership of their learning, offering them a space to tease out tough problems, explore possible solutions, and basically do the hard work that critical thinking requires.\nBlogs encourage creativity of expression by giving students a platform to experiment with a variety of genres, allowing for the unique personalities of both students and faculty to emerge.\nBlogs create multimodal spaces capable of hosting a wide variety of multimedia: oftentimes images, audio, video, and other media can communicate ideas more effectively than written text.\nBlogs give students opportunities to address audiences other than their professors: their posts could be read by other students, their parents, and visitors from across the globe.\nBlogs foster opportunities for reflection and provide them with tangible evidence of their learning over time: students can look at their previous posts to identify recurrent patterns in their thinking, times of change or growth, and other markers of learning and development.\nBlogs familiarize students with widely-used web content platforms: The knowledge and skills gained by writing and maintaining a blog are transferrable to a wide variety of work contexts, as blogging platforms (particularly Wordpress) power an increasing number of websites around the world.\n\nTony Bates also promotes blogs as he discussing Open pedagogy in Teaching in a Digital Age. He quotes Hegarty (2015), in describing eight attributes of open pedagogy. Consider how your class blogs can impact more than just your class.\n\nparticipatory technologies: socially constructed media such as blogs, wikis and other ‘sharing’ social media; people, openness and trust: students’ willingness to learn is fragile, with participation and interactions unlikely to flourish unless an element of trust can be built (Mak et., 2010);\ninnovation and creativity: finding new models of teaching and learning that better exploit OER and more emphasis on choosing digital technologies and methods that encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources;\nsharing ideas and resources: an open pedagogy needs peers to share willingly within a connected and trusting and professional community;\nconnected community: a technologically linked community with common interests;\nlearner-generated: this requires ‘opening up’ the process to empower students to take the lead, solve problems, and work collectively to produce artifacts that they share, discuss, reconfigure, and redeploy\nreflective practice: when students and teachers collaborate in partnerships, it facilitates deeper pedagogical reflection\npeer review: Conole (2014) sees learners as publishers and users of a range of open tools, with peer interactions and critique embedded in the learning experience.\n\nSource: Hegarty, B. (2015) Attributes of open pedagogy: a model for using open educational resources Educational Technology, July-August Referenced in section 11.4 Open pedagogy in Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates.\n\n\n\n5.4.5 Activity: Resources on Blogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nSection 11.4 Open pedagogy in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nUsing Blogs in the Classroom\nTeaching with Blogs\n\nNote that WordPress is a common blogging website used at Trinity and all first year students are required to set up and use a blog for their Foundations courses. See this WordPress Guide to set up your own account and get started with blogging! It can also be used for a course website, rather than have content in Moodle. (We also use Grav as an alternative to WordPress, so please chat with our online team for options that best suit you, your course, and your learners!)\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nWould you use a blog activity/assessment in your course? For what purpose?\nWhat are the key challenges for you as the instructor and for your students?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.6 Portfolios\nPortfolios, whether electronic or otherwise, are another common type of assessment in online courses.\nClemson University (n.d.) categorizes portfolios into three main types:\n\nShowcase portfolio: Highlights achievements.\nLearning portfolio: Demonstrates the learning process with a focus on feedback.\nAssessment portfolio: Used to assess students’ competency on certain standards or topics.\n\nSource: Wiley Education Services - Center for Teaching and Learning\nScully et al. (2018) explains that in the university context, “learning portfolios are typically used with the dual intention of (i) encouraging critically self-reflective lifelong learning and (ii) gathering evidence of broad skills and competencies that may enhance future employment prospects” (p.iii). The authors warn portfolios are only effective if instructors and learners understand the process of reflection. “Effortful design, explicit scaffolding and sufficient time are needed” (p.10).\nIf you’ve ever created a portfolio yourself, you know it takes a lot of reflection and critical thinking as you select evidence of your learning or achievements. An ePortfolio in particular adds an element of vulnerability, as learners may share their successes and struggles openly. This is a great opportunity for peers to learn the process/products of learning from each other.\nSkim the resources in the activity below and consider whether portfolios will help your students demonstrate the learning outcomes for your course.\n\n\n5.4.7 Activity: Resources on Portfolios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nGuidelines for ePortfolios in Higher Education\nThe Learning Portfolio in Higher Education: A Game of Snakes and Ladders by Scully, D., O’Leary, M. & Brown, M. (2018).\nePortfolios Explained: Theory and Practice\nePortfolios from the Association of American Colleges & Universities. This has a couple interesting examples of portfolios for learning, assessment, and employment.\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nDo your students need to demonstrate a process of learning, or critically reflect on their work? Would a portfolio help them achieve those outcomes?\nWhat are some questions or concerns you have about ePortfolios?\n\nHave you added your ideas to our shared chalkboard yet? Please consider sharing your experiences or questions about the three assessment types we’ve addressed so far. To add an idea, click the + icon. You can also “like” others’ ideas and make comments, so please make use of this tool!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.8 Quizzes\nTest, exams, quizzes…these are essential to many courses, however, there is definitely an art to designing an effective and fair test. An what about online tests? How do we prevent students from cheating…or confirm the identity of the test-taker? Several questions arise when designing tests for online courses. First, let’s pause and consider the use and effectiveness of formative, ungraded tests.\n\nFormative Quizzes\nIn our online courses, we think about the assessments and whether students have enough guidance and practice. For low-level memorization of key terms for example, you could create flashcards or quizzes (e.g. matching, fill-in-the blank, multiple choice, etc.). Yes, it may take some time to create, but our online team can help you! Once we receive the terms and definitions from instructors we typically use h5P, an open source application that seamlessly integrates into Moodle (and other websites).\nHere are some examples from our courses:\nSample 1: Flashcards\n\n\n\nSample 2: Drag the Words\n\n\n\nSample 3: Multiple Choice\n\n\n\n!! Note that H5P is an application in Moodle, so you can create your own quizzes and use it for graded assessments.\n\n\nGraded Quizzes, Tests & Exams\nFor your graded assessments, there are some key questions to ask:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the assessment?\nDoes it test the level of understanding that I need to assess?\nAre the instructions clear?\nWhat question types are effective to help students explain what they know (short answer, multiple choice, etc.)\nHow easy will it be for students to look up the answers as they take the test?\n\nWe’ve provided some resources below that may help you address some of these questions. Considering the last one in particular, you may want to take the following measures as you design your assessment:\n\nSet a time limit.\nHave a question bank. Moodle can select from a number of questions and randomize the quiz numbers for each student.\nCraft your questions to include more higher-order thinking skills - requiring more application, rather than retrieving facts from their textbook.\nRemember, your usual in-class test could now be considered a take home test. Students will have all of their resources available to check. Perhaps encourage them to use them! The time limit will help focus students.\nAnd lastly…consider what could be assessed in a different assignment format (e.g. video essay, journal response, case study report).\n\n\n\n\n5.4.9 Activity: Resources on Quizzes & Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nWriting effective test questions:\n\nDeveloping Written Tests\nExam questions: types, characteristics, and suggestions\nWriting Good Multiple Choice Test Questions\nHow to Prepare Better Multiple-Choice Test Items\nConstructing Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.10 Case Studies, Simulations & Role Plays\nCase studies, simulations, and role plays are a great methods to strengthen students’ critical thinking skills, as they often need to analyze issues, solve problems, and make decisions. They can be especially effective as group assignments, perhaps allowing for some “disorienting dilemmas” that cause transformational learning.\nConsider having your students write and analyze case studies for an assignment. Or better yet, contribute to OPEN CASE STUDIES AT UBC, an interdisciplinary, open educational resource with case studies that can be used by anyone.\n\n\n5.4.11 Activity: Resources for Case Studies, Simulations & Role Plays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nCase Studies:\n\nFree cases from the Case Centre\nCase Depositories\nWorld’s Best Case Studies\n\nCase Study Tips for Faculty & Students:\n\nCreating Effective Scenarios, Case Studies, and Role Plays\nCengage Learning: Case Studies\n\nSimulations & Role Plays:\n\nEverest Leadership and Team Simulation from Harvard\nRole Playing Activities​\nRole Playing: lesson and examples\n​Role-Playing Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.12 Essays, Projects, & Interviews\nIf you use essays, projects, and interviews in your courses, what are some techniques you use to aid students, or some common problems? What adjustments do you foresee for an online course? Here are some questions to consider:\n\nWhat does the ‘drafting stage’ look like for these projects? Do you give formative feedback to students before they hand in their final project?\nWhat online tools can students use? (e.g. Google docs to collaborate, Zoom for presentations, etc.)\nHow do I prevent cheating and plagiarism in student writing?\n\nWe’re going to address a couple of these questions in our synchronous zoom sessions and later units. For now, check out the resources for some tips on these issues.\n\n\n5.4.13 Activity: Cheating in an Online Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkim the following resources:\n\nStrategies to Reduce Cheating in online courses\nStudent Equity: Discouraging Cheating in Online Courses\n\n!! Now some of you might say, “Turnitin is a good tool to prevent cheating”…but this is definitely contested. In one of our Zoom sessions, we’ll discuss this topic in detail and will post the video for asynchronous viewing. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n5.4.14 Video & Audio Assignments\nHow do you currently integrate technology/media into your assignments? Is there an opportunity for personalization or creativity in the way information is presented? Let’s discuss utilizing media in your assignments, such as video and audio applications.\nVideo Assessments\nMost students have access to a video recording device (their cell phones), so why not take advantage of that! Consider how you might use video assessments in your course. Students can record a video blog, give a presentation, show their field trip, demonstrate a procedure…the list goes on. Storytelling is a key feature of video assignments, so consider how students can connect the course content to their own personal or professional experience. Another way to use videos is for students to analyze videos online related to your course.\nPodcasts Podcasts can be another engaging alternative/addition to a typical essay, project, interview or presentation. See the following sample assignment from a Trinity course, as well as the resources in the learning activity below.\nSample Podcast Activity/Assessment:\n\n\n5.4.15 Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. Audio I and Audio II in the Digital Literacy section of the orientation will explain how to set up your podcast. You can find the link to the orientation here.\nIf you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved.\n\n\n\n5.4.15.0.1 Instructions:\n\nUsing one of the practical problems you identified from learning activity 8.1, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.\nRecord that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.\nYour introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.\nYour project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.\nYour project idea should be clear and well organized.\nYour project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.\nProvide a conclusion that gives a call to action.\nUpload your podcast to soundcloud.com, tapewrite.com, or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on the Unit 8 discussion forum.\n\nReminder: Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.\n\nNote this podcast is part of your assessment for this unit. See Unit 8 Assessment for more details.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.16 Activity: Resources on Video & Audio Assignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nVideo Assignments\n\nBest practices for video assignments\nAn Online Video Assignment (that is Fun to Grade!): See the video analysis examples for this assignment. ​- Sample Video Assignment: GEOL 109 | The Earth and Life Through Time\nVideo Assignment Instructions: OERu micro-course on Project Management\nPowtoon: Create animated videos and presentations\n\nPodcasts\n\nHear This! Podcasts as an assessment tool in higher education\nCreative Assignments: Podcasting\n\n\n\n\nOnline is…\n Wordcloud of TONE participants answers “What do you think of when we say online?” - made with WordItOut\n\n\n\n5.4.17 Images & Graphic Organizers\nImages and graphic organizers can be powerful tools in many types of assignments. Just as we use visuals in our teaching for various reasons, students can include them in assignments to engage the reader, present complex information quickly and clearly, and communicate effectively.\nIn the resources below you’ll see several digital tools that may be useful for you in your teaching, as well as for your students in their assignments. Be sure to give enough instructions and guidance when recommending a tool, and ensure the focus is on demonstrating the mastery of a course learning outcome (not the technology).\n\n\n5.4.18 Activity: Digital Tools for Images & Graphic Organizers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the following resources:\nGraphic Organizers / Concept Maps\n\nCmap: concepts maps to construct, navigate, share and criticize knowledge models\nMind Meister: Collaborate on mind maps in real time.\nDraw Io: create diagrams by dragging and dropping pre-existing icons and shapes from a menu\nCacoo: Create diagrams online real time collaboration.\nZeeMaps\n\nTimelines\n\nH5P Timeline: Plug in for Moodle or WordPress.\nWhen in Time: Create, view, share interactive digital timelines.\nTime Toast: A bullet point centered timeline w/ text and pictures.\nPreceden: A fun easy site to use to create interactive timelines.\nOffice Timeline: To integrate into PowerPoint.\nNeatline\n\nInfographics\n\neasel.ly\nInfogram\nCanva\n\nMindmaps/Word Clusters:\n\nWord It Out\nWordle\nWord Art\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.19 And More!\nThere are, of course, so many more assessment tools and ideas that may work well for you and your learners.

    "section": "5.5 Unit Overview",
    "text": "5.5 Unit Overview\nWe typically start with an overview of what is in the unit - what are the key ideas, how does it connect to the rest of the course, why does this matter to students, etc. This is one way the instructor can connect to students, to set the stage for learning, and to really bring in your teacher’s voice or presence. Many instructors use video to share the unit overview, as this can personalize the experience for students.\n\nThe Unit Overview also includes the unit Topics, Learning Outcomes, Activities, and Resources. We include these details as it allows students to plan their week, make time for activities and assessments, ensure they have the required resources, and to know what the purpose is of the unit (learning outcomes).\n\nTopics\nAfter giving a preview of the unit in the Overview section, we typically list the topics. Now, you may think that your unit/lesson is just one main topic, but consider if that can be broken down a bit more. A bit later we’ll discuss why we “chunk” information, but for now as you think about a unit and fill out your course blueprint, try to break down your main topic into subtopics.\n\n\nUnit Learning Outcomes\nLearning outcomes describe what learners will be able to know, do and value after a learning experience. They clearly explain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students will gain through a course.\nIt is crucial to have measurable learning outcomes listed on the course outline, as they communicate expectations to the learner and help guide the instructor. We also encourage instructors to list the learning outcomes for each unit/lesson, as again, this helps students know what to aim for.\nWriting SMART Learning Outcomes\n\nThe diagram above illustrates the five key principles in designing learning outcomes. They must be specific and clear, instructors must be able to measure successful completion of an outcome, and learners must be able to achieve them. Learning outcomes should also be relevant to the course and achievable within the time period allotted.\nFor more examples of learning outcomes, see our course text Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates.\n[details=“Want to know more about Learning Outcomes? Click to Open!”]\nBloom’s Taxonomy\n​Instructional designers often use Bloom’s Taxonomy to help write learning outcomes. The graphics below lists possible verbs to use in a learning outcome, as well as examples of activities and/or assessments. Just to give one example, if you are assessing the domain of analysis by asking student to compare, you may ask them to create and administer a survey. As you write your outcomes, what Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) are you promoting?\n “Bloom’s Taxonomy” flickr photo by Vandy CFT shared under a Creative Commons (BY) license \nFor more, see Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy from Iowa State University.\nSignificant Learning\nFink (2003) described learning as change in the learner. How can we tell what has changed in our students, or how the course has impacted them? In his book, Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing Colleges Courses, he asks instructors to consider what students will take away from the course. What are the long-term goals? What will they remember?\nThe image here shows Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning. Consider the various categories of learning as you write your outcomes. Will students apply their learning? Learn about themselves or others? Value a new idea or perspective? Become a self-directed learner? \nFink Significant Learning flickr photo by Laura B. Dahl shared under a Creative Commons (BY-NC) license\nSOLO Taxonomy\nAnother great resource that can help you write effective learning outcomes is the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) created by John Biggs and K. Colis. The images below show the 5 levels of understanding. As you write your outcomes, consider the increasing complexity of understanding students can demonstrate through assessments. How will they know what level they are at? Try to incorporate descriptions in a grading rubric that explain the connections you want students to make (e.g. analyze, compare, hypothesize, predict, etc.)\n\nSource: Diagram giving an overview of the SOLO Taxonomy approach. Wikipedia \nFor more information, see SOLO Taxonomy - John Biggs.\nOther great resources:\n\nLearning Outcome Generator\nLearning Objectives Maker [/details]\n\n\n\n5.5.1 Activities and Assessments\nIn the Overview section we often have an Activity Checklist - some indication of what is required of students in the units. This could be a brief list of readings/videos, learning activities, and assessments. Sample Activity Checklist \nWe will dive more the topics of activities and assessments a bit later.\n\n\n5.5.2 Resource List\nA final piece of information in the Unit Overview section is the resource list. We often list just the main resource (e.g. course text) and then let students know the rest of the resources will be linked within the unit. This allows students to plan for any texts/articles they must purchase. Listing the resources throughout the unit allows for scaffolding of learning, as well as a way to provide context and guiding questions for students, rather than a master list of resources.\n\n\n5.5.3 Activity: Writing Learning Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.8 Step six: set appropriate learning goals in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nConsider the question Bates asks: - Take a course you are teaching in class at the moment. Write down the learning goals. Given the need for developing the skills needed in a digital age, would you want to change the goals of this course? If so, would you have to change your teaching methods and/or use of technology?\n\nIn addition to the course learning outcomes listed in your syllabus, what are the unit learning outcomes? If you are planning out a course currently, consider taking the time to map out the lesson with these details in mind.",

    "text": "5.6 Unit Topics\nAfter we’ve given an Overview to the students about what is in the lesson/unit, the next step is to teach the topics. But how do we do this online? Hold a 1-3 hour Zoom session? (Often the answer is “NO!”) The teaching techniques you use in the classroom do not necessarily transfer to online. So, what are effective methods for teaching content in an online course?\n\n5.6.1 Using PowerPoint Slideshows\nWhen instructors are asked to put their course online, the default for many is to post the PowerPoints that they have created for their face-to-face classroom. The problem is…the online course is not face-to-face!! PowerPoint presentations were designed as a tool for when the speaker is presenting. If you simply put a 60 slide pwpt online for students to view - they are missing the teaching part! Here are some ways to use PowerPoint presentations in your online course:\n\nAdd audio or video: Please consider adding a voice to your slideshow, as the personal explanation of the slides is crucial for learning.\nShorten your presentations: 60 slides is a lot of content to digest at one time. Consider chunking your presentations into smaller subtopics so students can organize their learning and pause for interaction (see next point).\nPause for interaction! Add learning activities in the PowerPoints, such as posing questions for students to answer in their notes.\nAnd finally…Don’t use PowerPoint! For an online course, you have the option of simply putting the “teaching content” from your PowerPoint right into the course (like I’m doing here). Please consider what pieces of the pwpt need to remain in slideshow format, and what can simply be in the text.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Using Videos\nVideos are a great way to teach in an online course - and there are a variety of ways to do this.\n\nRecord your synchronous Zoom sessions. Our TOne course for example is doing this, for several reasons:\nIt’s a way to provide extra content to learners.\nIt provides a record of the sessions so students can review.\nIt allows students that were unable to attend the session to view the session at their own time.\nIt builds community! Some of our sessions for example are simply for Q&A and are learner-directed. We hope this format facilitates a Community of Inquiry where faculty can collaborate and share ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIST 107 Example Video\nWRSH 101 Example Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOne session Example Video\nTED Talk Example Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n! Note: We’ll go into more detail about how to use video later in the course. For now, if you’re interested in learning more about Zoom, see Using Video Conferencing\n\n\n5.6.3 Using Images & Graphic Organizers\n\nConsider the images used in this website. Do they grab your attention? Make you reflect on prior learning experiences? Pique your interest?\nImages can be powerful tools in your course design. As you write your units, explore various images and graphic organizers to engage students, and bring meaning to the text.\n\nFinding Images for Your Course Here are a couple of great search engines to find images. Please try to find free and open images – ones that have a Creative Commons license.\n\nPixabay\nGoogle Advanced Search\nWikimedia Commons\nUnsplash\nPexels\nCreative Commons\nFlickr Creative Commons\n\n\n\n5.6.4 Activity: Tell a Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a practice for writing about a topic in your course, try telling a story about it. Use your camera phone to record yourself, or simply write down your thoughts on paper. Explain the key concepts about a course topic - sharing what makes it interesting for you!\nTo help you get started, use a Liberating Structure exercise (we’ll talk more about LS in our activity section).\n!!! Ask, “Why is this topic important?” Write down your answer. Then ask, “Why is that?” Keep asking, “Why? Why? Why?” up to nine times or you can go no deeper because you have reached the fundamental purpose for this topic.\n\n\n\n\n5.6.5 Chunking Your Topics\nWe’ve mentioned chunking a couple times in this unit, but what does it really mean, and why is it important? Chunking “it”is the process of breaking down content into smaller, bite-sized bits of easily digestible information that are easy to comprehend, learn, and commit to memory” - eLearningindustry.com. When we discussed the principles of accessibility earlier, this is a key idea. As you write your units and put your course online, consider the lesson flow, the pauses for interaction (learning activities), and how best to organize content to help students learn.\n\n\n5.6.6 Activity: Resources on Chunking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.3 Step One: Decide how you want to teach from our course text. In particular, pay attention to section 12.3.4 “What NOT to do” where Tony talks about chunking online work into manageable chunks.\nSelect from the following resources to learn more about chunking.\n\nThe Art and Science of Teaching / Helping Students Process Information\nContent Chunking: The Basis To An Engaging And Well-Designed Course",

    "section": "5.7 Unit Learning Activities and Assessments",
    "text": "5.7 Unit Learning Activities and Assessments\nIn week two of our course, we will explore learning activities and assessments in detail, but for now, let’s talk about one key concept: making connections between learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments. \nLook at the learning outcomes of one of your lessons/units. How will students demonstrate their learning? The answer is often through assessment of some kind. But how do we prepare learners for the assessment? This is where the learning activities come in. Here are some of the learning activities we’ve had in this course so far:\n\nreading resources, watching videos, exploring websites\ntaking a quiz\nmaking a T-chart graphic organizer\nfilming a videos\nwriting about a topic\nanswering questions\nposting in a Discussion Forum\nattending a synchronous Zoom session\n\nAll of these learning activities are designed to help you think more deeply about the topics presented. They are ungraded (as should most activities be for your students) and optional. This presents a very low-stakes engagement option for students.\nThe trick with most online courses is motivating the students to actually do these non-graded activities.\nOne key way is to emphasize how the activities will help students succeed in their assessments. If for example, they have to analyze a case study in a major assignment, then they should be able to practice the skills needed to do this. If students are giving a presentation, ask students to record themselves practicing their presentation (better yet, to practice in front of peers).\nThere are several engaging learning activities and assessments that we will discuss next week. For now, consider whether there are clear connections between the outcomes, activities, and assessments in your course.\n\n5.7.1 Activity: Learning Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.9.10 Designing student activities in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nRead 50 CATs by Angelo and Cross on our Online OnRamp site\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat ungraded learning activities have worked well in your classes?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7.2 Instructional Design Models\nThere are several key models that influence the way we design online courses. Two that we’ll focus on are the ADDIE model and Backwards Design.\nThe ADDIE Process illustrates 5 phases of course development:  Source: Wikimedia\nBackwards Design (Fink, 2003; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) is where we first focus on the target: what knowledge, skills or attitudes do we want students to have at the end of the course? Second, how will they demonstrate this? Finally, what learning experiences will help students achieve this?\n\n\n5.7.3 Activity: Instructional Design Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 4.3 The ADDIE model in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nWatch the following video on the ADDIE model.\n\n\n\nView the website and video Understanding by Design\nWatch the following video on Backwards Design.\n\n\n\nRead the details in this graphic and consider how you incorporate these questions/tasks in your course planning.\n\nSource: Wikimedia\n\n\n\n5.7.3.0.1 Additional Resources\n\nInstructional Design Models\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nDoes the ADDIE model or Backwards Design work for you? Would it be helpful in planning your course?\n\n\n\n\n5.7.4 Course Design Process at TWU\nEvery course is different, and every course design experience is different. In this section we’d like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.\nPlease note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.\nOur Instructional Design team at TWU generally follows the following development process:     \n\nCreating a Course Blueprint\nThe most important part of course design is the planning. After the initial stages of needs analysis (what do the students/instructors need) and hiring phase (who will write the course), the development teach creates a plan, or a blueprint of the course.\nIn developing this document we focus on the development of learning outcomes that are measurable, and then ensure that the supporting activities and assessments are mapped directly to these outcomes.\nBelow are some examples of part of a blueprint document. For a current blueprint template for TWU courses, click on the following links: TWU Course Blueprint Template - Google doc; TWU Course Blueprint Template - Word version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!!! Note in the blueprint that there is a table for 10 units. This does not apply to all courses!! If you happen to work with an Instructional Designer in planning out your course, a key question will be how to organize the learning/content. This may work out to be 10 key units for a 12 week course, but each course is different.\n\n\n\n5.7.5 Activity: Starting a Course Blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.9 Step seven: design course structure and learning activities from our course text.\nTake a couple minutes to download the TWU course blueprint template (Google doc or Word version). Start mapping out a course you need to plan. Even if it’s just to add the course description and course learning outcomes - it’s a start! This blueprint process usually takes some time and contemplation, especially figuring out the unit learning outcomes and resources.\nLet’s move on to the next topic, where will address the next steps in the process, including creating content, activities and assessments.\nNice work!\nThe internet is full of serendipitous surprises, and you should take advantage of that. Use links in your course materials to extend understanding, provide context, and promote curiosity.\nIf you have an image you’d like to share, send me a link at [safe-email autolink=“true”]colin.madland@twu.ca[/safe-email] and I’ll add it as a header to one of our pages, along with credit, of course.",

You might be familiar with Ferris Bueller’s economics teacher in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.\n\n5.16.1 Ferris Bueller’s Economics teacher\n\n\n\nOr, perhaps, you are familiar with this scene from the 1950s, which might be analogous to some teachers who simply throw everything at their learners in a way that is far too fast for their learners to process. Some people also call this method ‘drinking from a fire hose’.\n\n\n5.16.2 Lucy and Ethel at the Chocolate Factory\n\n\n\n\n\n5.16.3 Predicting school in Y2K.\nOr, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France predicting what school would look like in the year 2000.

You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article.\nDigital native\nAside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to create a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.\n\n\n\n\n5.18.2 Residents and Visitors\nI’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.\nAlternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you reside, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or maybe it’s a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else’s blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present.\nAt the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.\nThe video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).\n\n\n\nI’ve shared my VR Diagram below…\n\n\n\n\n\nTake some time to engage in the following activity.\n\n\n5.18.3 Activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?\n[details=“Click to open”] Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice.

[/details]\nhttps://www.nap.edu/read/24783/chapter/10\n\nBox 8-1 (Affordances of technology)\nhow would you rank the importance or relevance of each of the 8 affordances listed? What other affordances can you see in technology in education?\n\nIn order to build a Community of Reflection and Practice (the TOnE CORP), we encourage you to connect with someone who can provide support. Here is a structure we will use in this course and which you are encouraged to replicate in your own courses.\n\n\n\nLearning Partners\nEach learner should identify one learning partner who will be their first contact when they have a question about the logistics of the course and expectations from the instructor. Your learning partner will be your ‘go-to’ person for all sorts of questions about due dates, assignment instructions, procedures, where to find resources, etc.\n\n\nLearning Pods\nEach set of learning partners will also connect with another set of learning partners to form a learning pod. Learning pods should meet regularly outside of our scheduled meeting times to discuss the course content. This is an opportunity for peer review of your individual work, questions about difficult concepts, and other content-related items.\n\n\nRationale\nOne of the common complaints about remote learning is that both learners and faculty feel very isolated and alone. It is important to provide some structure to encourage learner-learner interactions. Faculty who have used this strategy report that comments show up in end of course ‘evaluations’ that learners, for the first time in their degree, made a friend because of this course structure. Social connections are critical for many learners. Furthermore, encouraging learners to review each others’ work is a cognitive task that encourages deep approaches to learning.\n\n\nUse the link below to find a learning partner and pod.\nSandstorm\n\n\n\nAliquam nulla felis, fringilla nec lobortis a, faucibus a magna.

    "text": "5.1 What is Multi-Access Learning?\nOnline learning, blended learning, flipped classroom, face-to-face, hybrid course, multi-access… you may have heard some of these terms tossed around, especially recently with the shifting focus to online. Before we unpack and examine these modalities of learning, consider how learning in Higher Education has changed. Not just recently with the impact of COVID-19, but the shifts that have happened in the last 20, 10, 5 years. How has technology shaped the way you teach and the way your students learn?\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Reflecting on Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkim Chapter 1: Fundamental Change in Education of our core text, Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates. See in particular sections 1.6-1.8.\nQuestions to Consider: - What changes have you seen in Online Learning? - What does “online” look like at TWU? - What changes to you foresee in the next few years and how does this affect you, your course, and your students?\nOne trend that is gaining traction is Multi-Access Learning. Read the following excerpt from Realigning Higher Education for the 21st-Century Learner through Multi-Access Learning by Irvine, Code & Richards (2013).\n! “Multi-access learning is an opportunity to meet both student needs for access to learning experiences and faculty needs for graduate student recruitment (Irvine, 2009; Irvine & Code, 2011, 2012; Irvine & Richards, 2013). Irvine defines multi-access learning as a framework for enabling students in both face-to-face and online contexts to personalize learning experiences while engaging as a part of the same course. Multi-access learning is different than blended learning because it places the student at the center of the learning experience as opposed to the instructor or the institution.\n! Further, “blended learning” is a problematic term due to its multiple interpretations in the literature and in daily practice, leaving one to ask, “Who controls the blend?” When and where the face-to-face sessions occur and when and how the online synchronous or asynchronous sessions occur are often controlled in blended learning settings. At the core, the institution or instructor is in control of the blend, no matter the configuration.\n! Multi-access learning, however, has the learner at the center, with the ability to choose how he/she wants to access the course. The core principle of the multi-access framework is one of enabling student choice in terms of the combination of course delivery methods through which the learning environment is accessed; that is, each individual learner decides how he/she wishes to take the course (e.g., face-to-face or online) and can then participate with other students and the instructor – each of whom have their own modality preferences – at the same time” (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).\nSource: Tiers of the multi-access framework (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).\nWith the uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, multi-access learning has great potential for our education system. This modality not only brings more choice to students, but promotes a learner-centred course design and best practices in teaching and learning.\nView the following video that explains multi-access learning:\n\n\n\nMulti Access from Scott Macklin on Vimeo.\n[details=“Read more about the 4 tiers of multi-access learning.”]\n\n\n\n5.1.1.0.1 Tier 1\nThe first tier of multi-access learning is what most of you have experienced (as learners and faculty) as the predominant modality of higher education, face-to-face (f2f). F2f learning environments are often assumed to be the preferred modality of learning because a f2f classroom allows for rich, multi-modal interactions and robust community-building. This is true to an extent, but only if class sizes are very small; large, lecture-based classrooms present significant challenges to building the kind of critical and safe community for engaged interaction.\n\n\n5.1.1.0.2 Tier 2\nThe second tier of access allows learners who cannot travel to a central campus (like during a worldwide pandemic) to participate in a learning community syncronously via video conferencing. Remote and local learners may exchange items and artifacts and may share video feeds and use software such as Etherpad or screensharing through the web-conferencing tool to collaborate on documents for co-creation of content.\n\n\n5.1.1.0.3 Tier 3\nThe third tier provides asynchronous access for remote learners who cannot join the scheduled class session due to any number of constraints (employment, child/elder care, time-zone, or even network bandwidth). Irvine, et al. acknowledge that simply viewing a recording of a synchronous session, regardless of how collaborative and engaging that session may have been, is a much leaner experience for learners and may not be optimal. This highlights the need to provide learning materials in formats beyond video and audio, perhaps including text-based materials and asynchronous tools for co-creation of content such as GitHub.\n\n\n5.1.1.0.4 Tier 4\nThe outermost tier of the model is for open participation from non-credit learners who are choosing to participate for their own interest and edification. It may seem anathema to some faculty to consider opening their course to the world, but the benefits can be significant, particularly in times like the spring of 2020.\n!!!! This course is designed to take advantage of all four tiers of the multi-access model (except f2f for now…). Anyone is welcome to follow along at multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020.\n[/details]\nSo what does this look like in a course? The activity below provides some examples, but let’s first take a look at a common learning activity in a course: Class Discussions. What does this look like in your face-to-face course? How about in a fully online course - one with synchronous zoom sessions? What happens if a student cannot attend these synchronous sessions?\nAs you think about your courses, consider designing learning activities for these different modalities / access points. Students can participate in class discussions, synchronous zoom sessions, and asynchronous discussion forums - all while demonstrating their learning of the course learning outcomes and practicing skills of collaboration and critical thinking.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: Applying Multi-Access Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead COVID-19 Planning for Fall 2020: A Closer Look at Hybrid-Flexible Course Design. It provides some examples of multi-access (called HyFlex in this model).\nRead Introducing a New(-ish) Learning Mode: Blendflex/Hyflex\nSee the following example from Scott Macklin’s MCOM 313 Social Media Theory & Practice: Back Stage to a Course.\nWatch the following video as Mark Halvorson discusses multi-access learning in his courses:\n\n\n\nMulti Access Conversation with Mark Halvorson from Scott Macklin on Vimeo.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Activity: More on Multi-Access Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a close look at the following image. (Click to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blended - Multi-access learning, great spotlight #tiegrad talk by (_valeriei?) at #CanEdu14 flickr photo by giulia.forsythe shared into the public domain using Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0)\nNext, read Realigning Higher Education for the 21st-Century Learner through Multi-Access Learning by Irvine, Code and Richards (2013).\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat ideas surround multi-access learning, according to the image?\nWhat is your definition of multi-access learning?\nWhat initial questions or concerns do you have about multi-access learning.\nIf you needed to design a multi-access course, where would you start? What changes would you make to sharing course content (e.g. lectures), learning activities, and assessments?\n\nSo how does this Multi-Access model of learning compare to what you have experienced as an instructor? You may teach online, on campus, or have a blended approach in your courses. What are the key differences between these approaches and modalities?\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Activity: Key Terms and Modalities in Online Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 10: Modes of delivery of our course text, Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates.\nNext, take the following quiz to test your understanding of the modalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Activity: Resources in Online Models of learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about online models of learning, feel free browse through the following resources;\n\n\n\n\nThe Flipped Classroom: An Opportunity to Engage Millennials…\nFlipping the Classroom\nBlended Learning and Flipped Classrooms\nBlended Learning Activities from Linfield College. Compares face-to-face approach to online activities, including emailing assignments and feedback, student video presentations, online quizzes and discussions.\nBlended and Online Learning from Vanderbilt University. Tips include: know your learner, present a clear path through the material, promote metacognitive awareness, maintain a social presence, promote collaboration, promote active learning, and incorporate media.\n\n!!!

Simon Fraser University (2010) has defined experiential learning as:\n! “the strategic, active engagement of students in opportunities to learn through doing, and reflection on those activities, which empowers them to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical endeavours in a multitude of settings inside and outside of the classroom.”\nThe Experiential Learning model was developed in the 70’s by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.\n\nSource: The four steps in Kolb cycle. From Experiential Learning Theories by David Kolb. Wikipedia\nOther key models related to experiential learning are:\n\nactive learning,\ninquiry-based learning,\nproblem-based learning, and\ncollaborative learning.\n\nIn our condensed course, we won’t examine these models in depth (unfortunately!), but please see the resources listed in the learning activity below.\n\n\n5.4.2 Activity: Philosophy, Principles and Practices of Teaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkim Engaging Adult Learners: Philosophy, Principles and Practices by Jim Bryson\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\nHere are other optional resources to browse on design principles.\n\nVideo: 8 things to know about the experiential learning cycle\nKolb’s Learning Styles and Experiential Learning Cycle\nBest Practices: Active Learning\nExamples of Experiential Education at Carleton - Experiential Education\nInquiry-Based Learning | Centre for Teaching and Learning\nInquiry-based learning in higher education: Principal forms, educational objectives, and disciplinary variations\nAn Overview Of Cooperative Learning\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat principles and practices resonate with you?\nHow do these influence your course design?\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Activity: Methods of Teaching (Online & F2F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve had a very quick overview of some key design principles, how does this relate to online and face-to-face classrooms?\nRead Chapter 3: Methods of teaching: campus-focused and Chapter 4: Methods of teaching with an online focus.\nCreate a T-chart, comparing the campus class to the online class.\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Class\nOnline Class\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nIs there overlap between the modalities?\nCould you anticipate any problems with trying to use classroom models of teaching in online environments?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Learning should be ACCESSIBLE\nWe talked a bit about multi-access in the previous topic, but I want to focus on the barriers that might prevent students from learning.\n\nunpredictable internet access\nconfusing technology (pwpt, Moodle, etc.)\nlack of motivation\nlack of support\ndifficult navigation in course (e.g. hard to find assessment info, dropboxes, etc.)\nlanguage/cultural barriers\n\nWhat other concerns have you heard from students, or that you have felt yourself as you encounter a new learning tool?\nAs we design our courses, we want to incorporate inclusive learning, or principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 defines this approach to curriculum and teaching:\n! “The term ‘universal design for learning’ means a scientifically valid framework for guiding educational practice that– ! provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in the ways students respond or demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are engaged; and ! reduces barriers in instruction, provides appropriate accommodations, supports, and challenges, and maintains high achievement expectations for all students, including students with disabilities and students who are limited English proficient” (110th Congress, 2008).\nIn the learning activity below, there are several resources on Universal Design for Learning.

    "section": "6.1 Purpose of Assessment",
    "text": "6.1 Purpose of Assessment\nThink about why assessment is a part of your course. How does it benefit you and your learners?\nAssessment demonstrates whether, and to what degree, the learner has met the learning outcomes for the course. It often lets the instructor know what concepts students struggle with which informs their teaching. Assessments traditionally come in the form of tests or essays, but there are a number of other ways we can measure students’ understanding. First, let’s focus on what assessment is.\n\n6.1.1 Understanding Assessment: Formative & Summative\nAssessment can be for, of, and as learning.\n\n! Assessment for Learning, a type of formative assessment, is utilized by teachers in order to gain an understanding of their students’ knowledge and skills in order to guide instruction.\n!!!! Assessment of Learning is a summative assessment used primarily to compare students and report progress.\n!!! Assessment as learning is also a formative assessment which focuses on teaching students the metacognitive processes to evaluate their own learning and make adjustments.\nSource: UBC’s Assessment as Learning\nIn our courses, we often think first of the summative assessments – the final test, unit quiz, essay, etc. that sums of students’ knowledge. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their learning of the course and we give them a final grade.\nFormative assessments involve giving feedback and helping students learn from the assessment. This ‘forms’ students knowledge so they can further show their understanding of a topic. For example, practice quizzes before a final exam, peer reviews of an essay before the final paper, reflective journals, 1 minute papers, muddiest point, etc., There are numerous effective formative activities to help students and instructors assess learning before being graded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummative Assessment\nFormative Assessment\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nAt the end of a learning activity\nDuring a learning activity\n\n\nGoal\nTo make a decision\nTo improve learning\n\n\nFeedback\nFinal judgement\nReturn to material\n\n\nFrame of Reference\nSometimes normative (comparing each student against all others); sometimes criterion\nAlways criterion (evaluating students according to the same criteria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable from Wikipedia citing Charting your course: How to prepare to teach more effectively, Atwood, 2000.\n\n\n6.1.2 Alignment in Course Design\nSo how do we choose formative and summative assessemnts for our course? An important part of course design is checking that there is alignment between assessments and learning outcomes. If your learning outcome asks students to compare two theories, for example, how do they show you they can do that? Often instructors will have their assessments in mind before they write their learning outcomes. Whatever process you have, make sure that your course learning outcomes are assessed in your assignments. Try to include these connections in your syllabus, as in the example below: \n\n\n6.1.3 Promoting Experiential Learning, Accessibility & Transformation\nLet’s refer back to Unit 1 and our key ideas that Learning should be an Experience, it should be Accessible, and it should be Transformational. Do your learning activities and assessments promote these principles?\nIn Engaging Adult Learners: Philosophy, Principles and Practices, Jim Bryson suggest 5 questions to ask yourself when choosing activities/assessments:\n! 1. Are the instructions, the purpose and the intended learning outcome(s) for this activity clear enough to be correctly understood by all students? ! 1. Is this activity fair? Will all students be able to understand and participate in it as a learning exercise? What choices do they have? Is it related to course content and laid out in a logical manner? ! 1. Will this activity add to my students’ interest in content? Will they find it engaging and motivating? Will it stimulate curiosity and participation? ! 1. Is this activity relevant to the intended learning outcomes for the course? Is it relevant to student expectations? To my instructional goals? ! 1. Have I provided support for success in terms of information, curriculum content, discussion, interaction, activities and available resources?\nAs you decide what activities/assessments are appropriate for your course, refer back to these questions.\nNext, consider the following quote: !! ‘Can transformative learning theory be put into practice, and if yes, what are some of the differences it makes to the lives of learners?’… !! ‘Can disorienting dilemmas be triggered by carefully designed exercises, and, if yes, what are the effects on student transformative learning?’ !! From Putting transformative learning theory into practice.\nHow do we carefully design exercises (activities & assessments) that transform learners? How do we give them opportunities to explore and challenge their thinking?\nWatch the following video about Trinity’s Inquiry-Based Learning approach.\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider:\nBefore you move on to the learning activity, take a moment to jot down your thoughts on these questions:\n\nWhy do we assess?\nHow do I assess my students?\nAre there opportunities for students to practice what they are learning before an assessment?\nDo I give formative feedback that will help students be more successful in future assignments?\nHow do I design learning experiences that facilitate discovery, exploration, questioning, transformation, etc.?\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Activity: Assessment of Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 6.8 Assessment of learning from our course text.\nNext, select from the following resources:\n\nLearner Assessment in Online Courses: Best Practices & More\nThe Messy and Unpredictable Classroom\nAssessing Student Learning Online\nBest Practices: Alternative Assessments\nGuiding Principles for Assessment of Students’ Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Activity & Assessment Ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis topic is all about exploration and sharing. We’ll present a number of engaging learning activities with a range of purposes:\n\nFirst and foremost, the learning activity must align with your course/unit learning outcomes.\nActivities should also connect to assessments, allowing learners to practice and prepare for assignments.\nIn addition to your listed learning outcomes, there may be other skills the activities promote, including: collaboration, critical and creative thinking, quantitative and qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information literacy. (See TWU’s Student Learning Outcomes.)\n\nAs you explore the ideas and the links provided in this unit, you are encouraged to add your comments, ideas, experiences to our shared chalkboard (see chart below or click here for Padlet). Please let us know what activities/assignments have worked well in your class, or which you would like to try.

Focus on what will help students practice and achieve the learning outcomes.\n\nNow, let’s dive into our idea smorgasbord!",

    "text": "6.2 Grading Rubrics & Peer Assessment\n\n6.2.1 Grading with Rubrics\nWhen giving students an assignment, it is crucial to explain to them exactly what you’re looking for and how you will assess their work. A rubric is one tool that can be used to authentically assess learners. It contains the list of criteria that highlights the what the learner is expected to do or demonstrate. Along with the criteria, a rubric provides examples of what is expected at each level of performance, from poor to excellent. Providing this criteria up front to learners allows them to assess their progress and compare to a performance level.\nBelow are some examples of rubric use in our online courses.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice the last two in particular have a detailed range of “Needs Improvement” to “Exceeds Expectations”. If possible, try to work out the details of what you’re looking for at each level of mastery. This helps not only when you’re grading students’ work, but also when you need to explain the grade you gave.\n\n\n6.2.2 Peer Feedback\nOne last important topic to cover in our assessment unit is about the value of peer feedback. Peer assessment can:\n\nimprove student work/performance\noffer timely feedback\nreduce grading workload\nhelp make your grading criteria more clear (as students use it to evaluate their peers)\nallow for critical reflection (of students’ own work & their peers)\n\nTo this last point, consider as well asking students to self-evaluate their work, acknowledging feedback from peers and/or the instructor and setting goals for improvement.\n\n\n6.2.3 Activity: Rubrics & Peer Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nGrading Rubrics\n\nGrading with Rubrics\nWhat is a rubric?\nBest Practices for Designing Effective Rubrics\nGuidelines for Building Marking Rubrics\nCreating and Using Rubrics\n\nPeer Feedback\n\nBest Practices: Peer Assessment\nIdeas and Strategies for Peer Assessments\nPeer Assessment\nGuide to Peer-Assessment\nPeer Assessment Resource Document\n\n!!!!

Who would live in it with you?\nIf you actually had to do the work to map out the blueprint of your house, what are the components? What is the layout and design? What motivates you to make those design choices?\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a course is like planning, building, and moving into a house. You start with asking some key questions:\n\nWhat is the course? What are the ’big picture‘ ideas, or the main take-aways?\nHow does this course fit in with the program?\nIf a previous course exists, has there been any feedback from students and instructors? …and the most important questions:\nWho are the students? What is the typical age, gender, work experience, culture, etc.? What are their interests, learning styles, and needs?​\n\nAnother strategy to use before getting into the details of a course is identifying the Big Ideas (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Below is an image from Stanford University (adapted) that takes us through the process of deciding the big ideas, essential questions, key knowledge and skills, and learning activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Activity: What’s Your Metaphor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get into more of the design process and models, what’s your metaphor for designing a course? Does it seem like an impromptu marathon that is sprung on you, or a paced cooking experience where you can get creative with your own recipe? How about following the “easy” directions in assembling a child’s toy?\nWhatever your guiding metaphor is, consider your first steps. What are the big ideas of your course? What are the needs of your students?\nAs we move forward in course planning, select a course you’d like to focus on in these few weeks we have together. What are your key needs as we map out your course?\nIn the next sections, we’ll have a closer look at the design models that influence us, as well as the course design process at TWU.",

    "text": "7.4 Checking Your Learning\nBefore you move on to the next unit, check that you are able to:\nconsider the process for designing a course and what techniques apply to your own course design;\ndescribe the ADDIE and Backwards Design models of instructional design;\ndiscuss the components in an online unit of study, and the variety of approaches to present content;\nwrite effective learning outcomes that are linked to the assessment and learning activities in a unit;\nexamine the standards used to evaluate the design of online and blended courses.\n\n7.4.1 Reflective Journals\nWhat is your experience with passive learners? Those students who may sit in your class, read their texts, hand in assignments, but aren’t really engaged in their learning? Imagine now a more self-directed online course, where those same students get to choose whether to study the resources presented; they choose whether to listen to your video lectures, engage in online discussion forums, complete ungraded learning activities…how do you motivate these students to become ACTIVE learners?\nOne strategy that helps students become not only active learners, but reflective learners, is to promote Reflective Learning. This can be a part of several assignment types, but for now, let’s focus on Reflective Journals. This type of assignment can be structured with specific questions (related to the learning outcomes), or unstructured, allowing the learner to explore and reflect in their own way.\n\nUngraded Reflective Journals\nReflective Journals are common graded assignments, but they can also be used as ungraded learning activities to promote note-taking, reflection, critical thinking, etc.\nFor example, in some of our online courses we often have this note for students when we explain the ungraded learning activities in a unit:\n!! Note that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. You are strongly encouraged to complete them, as they are designed to help you succeed in your course assessments. You are encouraged to write your responses in a Reflective Learning Journal and refer back to your notes as you complete your assignments.\nMake the connection to assessment explicit as you encourage learners to engage in the activity, write their notes in a journal, and study these notes to prepare for assignments.\n\n\nGraded Reflective Journals\nAs a graded assignment, consider allowing students some flexibility in how they present their learning process.\nHere are some sample instructions we use in our online courses:\nSample 1: Introduction to the Reflective Journal !!!! A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. !!!! The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. !!!! Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.\nSample 2: Journal Instructions !!! Note that for this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your assignments. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, and apply to other contexts.\n!!! As you read and watch the resources in this unit, consider the following questions: !!! 1. In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a transformational leader. !!! 1. Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context. !!! 1. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and assignments. !!! As you prepare your assignments, refer to these notes.\nSample 3: Journal Instructions ! Answer the following questions in your Reflective Journal: ! 1. What terms were the most important concepts of this week’s lesson? Be sure to define any important terms in your own words. (2 paragraphs) ! 2. What was your muddiest point (that is, what did not make sense)? (1 paragraph). ! 3. What would you like to know more about from this lesson, and why? (1 paragraph) ! 4. How does this lesson relate to something you have already learned outside of this class? (1 paragraph) ! 5. Why do you think you were required to learn this content? (1 paragraph)\nFor more samples of journals used on TWU online courses, see the following Google doc.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Activity: Resources on Reflective Journals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\n\n\n7.4.2.0.1 Reflective Journals\n\n\n\n\nAssignment Type: Reflective Journals\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Discussions & Blogs\n\nDiscussions Forums\nDiscussion forums are a popular form of assessment for online courses. Which means, if students are taking several online courses at once…there is a certain amount of forum fatigue they may experience! Be sure to craft your discussion questions in a way that meets the unit learning outcomes, but also inspires collaboration, inquiry, and critical thinking.\nIn the activity below there are several resources and guides for facilitating discussions. In particular, pay attention to the various activity types you can have in discussion forums. For example:\n\nWeb Field Trips: Instructor provides a link or a series of links. Students follow the link(s) and report back through an instructor-defined set of questions.\nBrainstorming: Students set forth a series of ideas on a given topic without evaluation.\nProblem-Solving: Small groups work out a solution to a problem.\nWriting Groups: Students work together in groups of four or five to share drafts and provide peer response and peer-editing.\nCase Analysis: Students work independent on a common case followed by group analysis in the board.\nCollaborative Writing: Workgroups work together to create a single document – proposals and analytical reports work well – which they then post to the larger group for critique.\nCooperative Debate: Workgroups present perspectives on a particular issue, followed by a whole group consensus-building discussion.\nDiscussions of Course Readings: Instructor creates threaded discussions around assigned readings. Threads may include pre-reading (anticipation) activities, interpretations, evaluations, etc.\nResearch Bank: Students and instructor contribute links and citations to a common area for a classwide research topic.\n\nSource: Generating and Facilitating Engaging and Effective Online Discussions\nFor samples of discussion instructions, see the Journals & Discussions Google doc.\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Activity: Resources on Discussion Forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nGenerating and Facilitating Engaging and Effective Online Discussions\nCollaborative Online Learning: Fostering Effective Discussions\nDiscussion Boards: Valuable? Overused? Discuss.\n\nConsider now the differences between a Discussion Forum and a Blog. What is the purpose? What can learners do/share with either activity? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\nCreate a T-chart, comparing the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\nBlog\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogs\n\nBLOGS for Collaborative Learning & Peer Review, (calanthaelsby?) #tli2012 flickr photo by giulia.forsythe shared into the public domain using Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0)\nAnother reflective learning tool is a blog. It may take some courage for some students to post their thoughts online (and for faculty to step out of Moodle), but it can be very effective in helping students demonstrate their learning.\nIt’s important to let students know that blogs can be kept private. Students can share their link with their instructor, or post their link on Moodle so other students can see. It’s important to go over privacy considerations with students, as well as netiquette guidelines\nHere are some benefits to consider from How Do Blogs Support Learning?\n\nBlogs help grow learning communities by allowing students to share their own perspectives and experiences while learning about those of their classmates.\nBlogs let students take ownership of their learning, offering them a space to tease out tough problems, explore possible solutions, and basically do the hard work that critical thinking requires.\nBlogs encourage creativity of expression by giving students a platform to experiment with a variety of genres, allowing for the unique personalities of both students and faculty to emerge.\nBlogs create multimodal spaces capable of hosting a wide variety of multimedia: oftentimes images, audio, video, and other media can communicate ideas more effectively than written text.\nBlogs give students opportunities to address audiences other than their professors: their posts could be read by other students, their parents, and visitors from across the globe.\nBlogs foster opportunities for reflection and provide them with tangible evidence of their learning over time: students can look at their previous posts to identify recurrent patterns in their thinking, times of change or growth, and other markers of learning and development.\nBlogs familiarize students with widely-used web content platforms: The knowledge and skills gained by writing and maintaining a blog are transferrable to a wide variety of work contexts, as blogging platforms (particularly Wordpress) power an increasing number of websites around the world.\n\nTony Bates also promotes blogs as he discussing Open pedagogy in Teaching in a Digital Age. He quotes Hegarty (2015), in describing eight attributes of open pedagogy. Consider how your class blogs can impact more than just your class.\n\nparticipatory technologies: socially constructed media such as blogs, wikis and other ‘sharing’ social media; people, openness and trust: students’ willingness to learn is fragile, with participation and interactions unlikely to flourish unless an element of trust can be built (Mak et., 2010);\ninnovation and creativity: finding new models of teaching and learning that better exploit OER and more emphasis on choosing digital technologies and methods that encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources;\nsharing ideas and resources: an open pedagogy needs peers to share willingly within a connected and trusting and professional community;\nconnected community: a technologically linked community with common interests;\nlearner-generated: this requires ‘opening up’ the process to empower students to take the lead, solve problems, and work collectively to produce artifacts that they share, discuss, reconfigure, and redeploy\nreflective practice: when students and teachers collaborate in partnerships, it facilitates deeper pedagogical reflection\npeer review: Conole (2014) sees learners as publishers and users of a range of open tools, with peer interactions and critique embedded in the learning experience.\n\nSource: Hegarty, B. (2015) Attributes of open pedagogy: a model for using open educational resources Educational Technology, July-August Referenced in section 11.4 Open pedagogy in Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates.\n\n\n\n7.4.5 Activity: Resources on Blogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nSection 11.4 Open pedagogy in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nUsing Blogs in the Classroom\nTeaching with Blogs\n\nNote that WordPress is a common blogging website used at Trinity and all first year students are required to set up and use a blog for their Foundations courses. See this WordPress Guide to set up your own account and get started with blogging! It can also be used for a course website, rather than have content in Moodle. (We also use Grav as an alternative to WordPress, so please chat with our online team for options that best suit you, your course, and your learners!)\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nWould you use a blog activity/assessment in your course? For what purpose?\nWhat are the key challenges for you as the instructor and for your students?\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.6 Portfolios\nPortfolios, whether electronic or otherwise, are another common type of assessment in online courses.\nClemson University (n.d.) categorizes portfolios into three main types:\n\nShowcase portfolio: Highlights achievements.\nLearning portfolio: Demonstrates the learning process with a focus on feedback.\nAssessment portfolio: Used to assess students’ competency on certain standards or topics.\n\nSource: Wiley Education Services - Center for Teaching and Learning\nScully et al. (2018) explains that in the university context, “learning portfolios are typically used with the dual intention of (i) encouraging critically self-reflective lifelong learning and (ii) gathering evidence of broad skills and competencies that may enhance future employment prospects” (p.iii). The authors warn portfolios are only effective if instructors and learners understand the process of reflection. “Effortful design, explicit scaffolding and sufficient time are needed” (p.10).\nIf you’ve ever created a portfolio yourself, you know it takes a lot of reflection and critical thinking as you select evidence of your learning or achievements. An ePortfolio in particular adds an element of vulnerability, as learners may share their successes and struggles openly. This is a great opportunity for peers to learn the process/products of learning from each other.\nSkim the resources in the activity below and consider whether portfolios will help your students demonstrate the learning outcomes for your course.\n\n\n7.4.7 Activity: Resources on Portfolios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\n\nGuidelines for ePortfolios in Higher Education\nThe Learning Portfolio in Higher Education: A Game of Snakes and Ladders by Scully, D., O’Leary, M. & Brown, M. (2018).\nePortfolios Explained: Theory and Practice\nePortfolios from the Association of American Colleges & Universities. This has a couple interesting examples of portfolios for learning, assessment, and employment.\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nDo your students need to demonstrate a process of learning, or critically reflect on their work? Would a portfolio help them achieve those outcomes?\nWhat are some questions or concerns you have about ePortfolios?\n\nHave you added your ideas to our shared chalkboard yet? Please consider sharing your experiences or questions about the three assessment types we’ve addressed so far. To add an idea, click the + icon. You can also “like” others’ ideas and make comments, so please make use of this tool!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.8 Quizzes\nTest, exams, quizzes…these are essential to many courses, however, there is definitely an art to designing an effective and fair test. An what about online tests? How do we prevent students from cheating…or confirm the identity of the test-taker? Several questions arise when designing tests for online courses. First, let’s pause and consider the use and effectiveness of formative, ungraded tests.\n\nFormative Quizzes\nIn our online courses, we think about the assessments and whether students have enough guidance and practice. For low-level memorization of key terms for example, you could create flashcards or quizzes (e.g. matching, fill-in-the blank, multiple choice, etc.). Yes, it may take some time to create, but our online team can help you! Once we receive the terms and definitions from instructors we typically use h5P, an open source application that seamlessly integrates into Moodle (and other websites).\nHere are some examples from our courses:\nSample 1: Flashcards\n\n\n\nSample 2: Drag the Words\n\n\n\nSample 3: Multiple Choice\n\n\n\n!! Note that H5P is an application in Moodle, so you can create your own quizzes and use it for graded assessments.\n\n\nGraded Quizzes, Tests & Exams\nFor your graded assessments, there are some key questions to ask:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the assessment?\nDoes it test the level of understanding that I need to assess?\nAre the instructions clear?\nWhat question types are effective to help students explain what they know (short answer, multiple choice, etc.)\nHow easy will it be for students to look up the answers as they take the test?\n\nWe’ve provided some resources below that may help you address some of these questions. Considering the last one in particular, you may want to take the following measures as you design your assessment:\n\nSet a time limit.\nHave a question bank. Moodle can select from a number of questions and randomize the quiz numbers for each student.\nCraft your questions to include more higher-order thinking skills - requiring more application, rather than retrieving facts from their textbook.\nRemember, your usual in-class test could now be considered a take home test. Students will have all of their resources available to check. Perhaps encourage them to use them! The time limit will help focus students.\nAnd lastly…consider what could be assessed in a different assignment format (e.g. video essay, journal response, case study report).\n\n\n\n\n7.4.9 Activity: Resources on Quizzes & Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nWriting effective test questions:\n\nDeveloping Written Tests\nExam questions: types, characteristics, and suggestions\nWriting Good Multiple Choice Test Questions\nHow to Prepare Better Multiple-Choice Test Items\nConstructing Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.10 Case Studies, Simulations & Role Plays\nCase studies, simulations, and role plays are a great methods to strengthen students’ critical thinking skills, as they often need to analyze issues, solve problems, and make decisions. They can be especially effective as group assignments, perhaps allowing for some “disorienting dilemmas” that cause transformational learning.\nConsider having your students write and analyze case studies for an assignment. Or better yet, contribute to OPEN CASE STUDIES AT UBC, an interdisciplinary, open educational resource with case studies that can be used by anyone.\n\n\n7.4.11 Activity: Resources for Case Studies, Simulations & Role Plays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nCase Studies:\n\nFree cases from the Case Centre\nCase Depositories\nWorld’s Best Case Studies\n\nCase Study Tips for Faculty & Students:\n\nCreating Effective Scenarios, Case Studies, and Role Plays\nCengage Learning: Case Studies\n\nSimulations & Role Plays:\n\nEverest Leadership and Team Simulation from Harvard\nRole Playing Activities​\nRole Playing: lesson and examples\n​Role-Playing Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.12 Essays, Projects, & Interviews\nIf you use essays, projects, and interviews in your courses, what are some techniques you use to aid students, or some common problems? What adjustments do you foresee for an online course? Here are some questions to consider:\n\nWhat does the ‘drafting stage’ look like for these projects? Do you give formative feedback to students before they hand in their final project?\nWhat online tools can students use? (e.g. Google docs to collaborate, Zoom for presentations, etc.)\nHow do I prevent cheating and plagiarism in student writing?\n\nWe’re going to address a couple of these questions in our synchronous zoom sessions and later units. For now, check out the resources for some tips on these issues.\n\n\n7.4.13 Activity: Cheating in an Online Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkim the following resources:\n\nStrategies to Reduce Cheating in online courses\nStudent Equity: Discouraging Cheating in Online Courses\n\n!! Now some of you might say, “Turnitin is a good tool to prevent cheating”…but this is definitely contested. In one of our Zoom sessions, we’ll discuss this topic in detail and will post the video for asynchronous viewing. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n7.4.14 Video & Audio Assignments\nHow do you currently integrate technology/media into your assignments? Is there an opportunity for personalization or creativity in the way information is presented? Let’s discuss utilizing media in your assignments, such as video and audio applications.\nVideo Assessments\nMost students have access to a video recording device (their cell phones), so why not take advantage of that! Consider how you might use video assessments in your course. Students can record a video blog, give a presentation, show their field trip, demonstrate a procedure…the list goes on. Storytelling is a key feature of video assignments, so consider how students can connect the course content to their own personal or professional experience. Another way to use videos is for students to analyze videos online related to your course.\nPodcasts Podcasts can be another engaging alternative/addition to a typical essay, project, interview or presentation. See the following sample assignment from a Trinity course, as well as the resources in the learning activity below.\nSample Podcast Activity/Assessment:\n\n\n7.4.15 Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. Audio I and Audio II in the Digital Literacy section of the orientation will explain how to set up your podcast. You can find the link to the orientation here.\nIf you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved.\n\n\n\n7.4.15.0.1 Instructions:\n\nUsing one of the practical problems you identified from learning activity 8.1, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.\nRecord that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.\nYour introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.\nYour project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.\nYour project idea should be clear and well organized.\nYour project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.\nProvide a conclusion that gives a call to action.\nUpload your podcast to soundcloud.com, tapewrite.com, or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on the Unit 8 discussion forum.\n\nReminder: Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.\n\nNote this podcast is part of your assessment for this unit. See Unit 8 Assessment for more details.\n\n\n\n\n7.4.16 Activity: Resources on Video & Audio Assignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the following resources:\nVideo Assignments\n\nBest practices for video assignments\nAn Online Video Assignment (that is Fun to Grade!): See the video analysis examples for this assignment. ​- Sample Video Assignment: GEOL 109 | The Earth and Life Through Time\nVideo Assignment Instructions: OERu micro-course on Project Management\nPowtoon: Create animated videos and presentations\n\nPodcasts\n\nHear This!

Just as we use visuals in our teaching for various reasons, students can include them in assignments to engage the reader, present complex information quickly and clearly, and communicate effectively.\nIn the resources below you’ll see several digital tools that may be useful for you in your teaching, as well as for your students in their assignments. Be sure to give enough instructions and guidance when recommending a tool, and ensure the focus is on demonstrating the mastery of a course learning outcome (not the technology).\n\n\n7.4.18 Activity: Digital Tools for Images & Graphic Organizers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the following resources:\nGraphic Organizers / Concept Maps\n\nCmap: concepts maps to construct, navigate, share and criticize knowledge models\nMind Meister: Collaborate on mind maps in real time.\nDraw Io: create diagrams by dragging and dropping pre-existing icons and shapes from a menu\nCacoo: Create diagrams online real time collaboration.\nZeeMaps\n\nTimelines\n\nH5P Timeline: Plug in for Moodle or WordPress.\nWhen in Time: Create, view, share interactive digital timelines.\nTime Toast: A bullet point centered timeline w/ text and pictures.\nPreceden: A fun easy site to use to create interactive timelines.\nOffice Timeline: To integrate into PowerPoint.\nNeatline\n\nInfographics\n\neasel.ly\nInfogram\nCanva\n\nMindmaps/Word Clusters:\n\nWord It Out\nWordle\nWord Art\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.19 And More!\nThere are, of course, so many more assessment tools and ideas that may work well for you and your learners.

    "text": "7.5 Unit Overview\nWe typically start with an overview of what is in the unit - what are the key ideas, how does it connect to the rest of the course, why does this matter to students, etc. This is one way the instructor can connect to students, to set the stage for learning, and to really bring in your teacher’s voice or presence. Many instructors use video to share the unit overview, as this can personalize the experience for students.\n\nThe Unit Overview also includes the unit Topics, Learning Outcomes, Activities, and Resources. We include these details as it allows students to plan their week, make time for activities and assessments, ensure they have the required resources, and to know what the purpose is of the unit (learning outcomes).\n\nTopics\nAfter giving a preview of the unit in the Overview section, we typically list the topics. Now, you may think that your unit/lesson is just one main topic, but consider if that can be broken down a bit more. A bit later we’ll discuss why we “chunk” information, but for now as you think about a unit and fill out your course blueprint, try to break down your main topic into subtopics.\n\n\nUnit Learning Outcomes\nLearning outcomes describe what learners will be able to know, do and value after a learning experience. They clearly explain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students will gain through a course.\nIt is crucial to have measurable learning outcomes listed on the course outline, as they communicate expectations to the learner and help guide the instructor. We also encourage instructors to list the learning outcomes for each unit/lesson, as again, this helps students know what to aim for.\nWriting SMART Learning Outcomes\n\nThe diagram above illustrates the five key principles in designing learning outcomes. They must be specific and clear, instructors must be able to measure successful completion of an outcome, and learners must be able to achieve them. Learning outcomes should also be relevant to the course and achievable within the time period allotted.\nFor more examples of learning outcomes, see our course text Teaching in a Digital Age by Tony Bates.\n[details=“Want to know more about Learning Outcomes? Click to Open!”]\nBloom’s Taxonomy\n​Instructional designers often use Bloom’s Taxonomy to help write learning outcomes. The graphics below lists possible verbs to use in a learning outcome, as well as examples of activities and/or assessments. Just to give one example, if you are assessing the domain of analysis by asking student to compare, you may ask them to create and administer a survey. As you write your outcomes, what Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) are you promoting?\n “Bloom’s Taxonomy” flickr photo by Vandy CFT shared under a Creative Commons (BY) license \nFor more, see Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy from Iowa State University.\nSignificant Learning\nFink (2003) described learning as change in the learner. How can we tell what has changed in our students, or how the course has impacted them? In his book, Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing Colleges Courses, he asks instructors to consider what students will take away from the course. What are the long-term goals? What will they remember?\nThe image here shows Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning. Consider the various categories of learning as you write your outcomes. Will students apply their learning? Learn about themselves or others? Value a new idea or perspective? Become a self-directed learner? \nFink Significant Learning flickr photo by Laura B. Dahl shared under a Creative Commons (BY-NC) license\nSOLO Taxonomy\nAnother great resource that can help you write effective learning outcomes is the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) created by John Biggs and K. Colis. The images below show the 5 levels of understanding. As you write your outcomes, consider the increasing complexity of understanding students can demonstrate through assessments. How will they know what level they are at? Try to incorporate descriptions in a grading rubric that explain the connections you want students to make (e.g. analyze, compare, hypothesize, predict, etc.)\n\nSource: Diagram giving an overview of the SOLO Taxonomy approach. Wikipedia \nFor more information, see SOLO Taxonomy - John Biggs.\nOther great resources:\n\nLearning Outcome Generator\nLearning Objectives Maker [/details]\n\n\n\n7.5.1 Activities and Assessments\nIn the Overview section we often have an Activity Checklist - some indication of what is required of students in the units. This could be a brief list of readings/videos, learning activities, and assessments. Sample Activity Checklist \nWe will dive more the topics of activities and assessments a bit later.\n\n\n7.5.2 Resource List\nA final piece of information in the Unit Overview section is the resource list. We often list just the main resource (e.g. course text) and then let students know the rest of the resources will be linked within the unit. This allows students to plan for any texts/articles they must purchase. Listing the resources throughout the unit allows for scaffolding of learning, as well as a way to provide context and guiding questions for students, rather than a master list of resources.\n\n\n7.5.3 Activity: Writing Learning Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.8 Step six: set appropriate learning goals in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nConsider the question Bates asks: - Take a course you are teaching in class at the moment. Write down the learning goals. Given the need for developing the skills needed in a digital age, would you want to change the goals of this course? If so, would you have to change your teaching methods and/or use of technology?\n\nIn addition to the course learning outcomes listed in your syllabus, what are the unit learning outcomes? If you are planning out a course currently, consider taking the time to map out the lesson with these details in mind.",

    "text": "7.6 Unit Topics\nAfter we’ve given an Overview to the students about what is in the lesson/unit, the next step is to teach the topics. But how do we do this online? Hold a 1-3 hour Zoom session? (Often the answer is “NO!”) The teaching techniques you use in the classroom do not necessarily transfer to online. So, what are effective methods for teaching content in an online course?\n\n7.6.1 Using PowerPoint Slideshows\nWhen instructors are asked to put their course online, the default for many is to post the PowerPoints that they have created for their face-to-face classroom. The problem is…the online course is not face-to-face!! PowerPoint presentations were designed as a tool for when the speaker is presenting. If you simply put a 60 slide pwpt online for students to view - they are missing the teaching part! Here are some ways to use PowerPoint presentations in your online course:\n\nAdd audio or video: Please consider adding a voice to your slideshow, as the personal explanation of the slides is crucial for learning.\nShorten your presentations: 60 slides is a lot of content to digest at one time. Consider chunking your presentations into smaller subtopics so students can organize their learning and pause for interaction (see next point).\nPause for interaction! Add learning activities in the PowerPoints, such as posing questions for students to answer in their notes.\nAnd finally…Don’t use PowerPoint! For an online course, you have the option of simply putting the “teaching content” from your PowerPoint right into the course (like I’m doing here). Please consider what pieces of the pwpt need to remain in slideshow format, and what can simply be in the text.\n\n\n\n7.6.2 Using Videos\nVideos are a great way to teach in an online course - and there are a variety of ways to do this.\n\nRecord your synchronous Zoom sessions. Our TOne course for example is doing this, for several reasons:\nIt’s a way to provide extra content to learners.\nIt provides a record of the sessions so students can review.\nIt allows students that were unable to attend the session to view the session at their own time.\nIt builds community! Some of our sessions for example are simply for Q&A and are learner-directed. We hope this format facilitates a Community of Inquiry where faculty can collaborate and share ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIST 107 Example Video\nWRSH 101 Example Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOne session Example Video\nTED Talk Example Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n! Note: We’ll go into more detail about how to use video later in the course. For now, if you’re interested in learning more about Zoom, see Using Video Conferencing\n\n\n7.6.3 Using Images & Graphic Organizers\n\nConsider the images used in this website. Do they grab your attention? Make you reflect on prior learning experiences? Pique your interest?\nImages can be powerful tools in your course design. As you write your units, explore various images and graphic organizers to engage students, and bring meaning to the text.\n\nFinding Images for Your Course Here are a couple of great search engines to find images. Please try to find free and open images – ones that have a Creative Commons license.\n\nPixabay\nGoogle Advanced Search\nWikimedia Commons\nUnsplash\nPexels\nCreative Commons\nFlickr Creative Commons\n\n\n\n7.6.4 Activity: Tell a Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a practice for writing about a topic in your course, try telling a story about it. Use your camera phone to record yourself, or simply write down your thoughts on paper. Explain the key concepts about a course topic - sharing what makes it interesting for you!\nTo help you get started, use a Liberating Structure exercise (we’ll talk more about LS in our activity section).\n!!! Ask, “Why is this topic important?” Write down your answer. Then ask, “Why is that?” Keep asking, “Why? Why? Why?” up to nine times or you can go no deeper because you have reached the fundamental purpose for this topic.\n\n\n\n\n7.6.5 Chunking Your Topics\nWe’ve mentioned chunking a couple times in this unit, but what does it really mean, and why is it important? Chunking “it”is the process of breaking down content into smaller, bite-sized bits of easily digestible information that are easy to comprehend, learn, and commit to memory” - eLearningindustry.com. When we discussed the principles of accessibility earlier, this is a key idea. As you write your units and put your course online, consider the lesson flow, the pauses for interaction (learning activities), and how best to organize content to help students learn.\n\n\n7.6.6 Activity: Resources on Chunking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.3 Step One: Decide how you want to teach from our course text. In particular, pay attention to section 12.3.4 “What NOT to do” where Tony talks about chunking online work into manageable chunks.\nSelect from the following resources to learn more about chunking.\n\nThe Art and Science of Teaching / Helping Students Process Information\nContent Chunking: The Basis To An Engaging And Well-Designed Course",

    "section": "7.7 Unit Learning Activities and Assessments",
    "text": "7.7 Unit Learning Activities and Assessments\nIn week two of our course, we will explore learning activities and assessments in detail, but for now, let’s talk about one key concept: making connections between learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments. \nLook at the learning outcomes of one of your lessons/units. How will students demonstrate their learning? The answer is often through assessment of some kind. But how do we prepare learners for the assessment? This is where the learning activities come in. Here are some of the learning activities we’ve had in this course so far:\n\nreading resources, watching videos, exploring websites\ntaking a quiz\nmaking a T-chart graphic organizer\nfilming a videos\nwriting about a topic\nanswering questions\nposting in a Discussion Forum\nattending a synchronous Zoom session\n\nAll of these learning activities are designed to help you think more deeply about the topics presented. They are ungraded (as should most activities be for your students) and optional. This presents a very low-stakes engagement option for students.\nThe trick with most online courses is motivating the students to actually do these non-graded activities.\nOne key way is to emphasize how the activities will help students succeed in their assessments. If for example, they have to analyze a case study in a major assignment, then they should be able to practice the skills needed to do this. If students are giving a presentation, ask students to record themselves practicing their presentation (better yet, to practice in front of peers).\nThere are several engaging learning activities and assessments that we will discuss next week. For now, consider whether there are clear connections between the outcomes, activities, and assessments in your course.\n\n7.7.1 Activity: Learning Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.9.10 Designing student activities in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nRead 50 CATs by Angelo and Cross on our Online OnRamp site\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat ungraded learning activities have worked well in your classes?\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.2 Instructional Design Models\nThere are several key models that influence the way we design online courses. Two that we’ll focus on are the ADDIE model and Backwards Design.\nThe ADDIE Process illustrates 5 phases of course development:  Source: Wikimedia\nBackwards Design (Fink, 2003; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) is where we first focus on the target: what knowledge, skills or attitudes do we want students to have at the end of the course? Second, how will they demonstrate this? Finally, what learning experiences will help students achieve this?\n\n\n7.7.3 Activity: Instructional Design Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 4.3 The ADDIE model in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nWatch the following video on the ADDIE model.\n\n\n\nView the website and video Understanding by Design\nWatch the following video on Backwards Design.\n\n\n\nRead the details in this graphic and consider how you incorporate these questions/tasks in your course planning.\n\nSource: Wikimedia\n\n\n\n7.7.3.0.1 Additional Resources\n\nInstructional Design Models\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nDoes the ADDIE model or Backwards Design work for you? Would it be helpful in planning your course?\n\n\n\n\n7.7.4 Course Design Process at TWU\nEvery course is different, and every course design experience is different. In this section we’d like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.\nPlease note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.\nOur Instructional Design team at TWU generally follows the following development process:     \n\nCreating a Course Blueprint\nThe most important part of course design is the planning. After the initial stages of needs analysis (what do the students/instructors need) and hiring phase (who will write the course), the development teach creates a plan, or a blueprint of the course.\nIn developing this document we focus on the development of learning outcomes that are measurable, and then ensure that the supporting activities and assessments are mapped directly to these outcomes.\nBelow are some examples of part of a blueprint document. For a current blueprint template for TWU courses, click on the following links: TWU Course Blueprint Template - Google doc; TWU Course Blueprint Template - Word version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!!! Note in the blueprint that there is a table for 10 units. This does not apply to all courses!! If you happen to work with an Instructional Designer in planning out your course, a key question will be how to organize the learning/content. This may work out to be 10 key units for a 12 week course, but each course is different.\n\n\n\n7.7.5 Activity: Starting a Course Blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead section 12.9 Step seven: design course structure and learning activities from our course text.\nTake a couple minutes to download the TWU course blueprint template (Google doc or Word version). Start mapping out a course you need to plan. Even if it’s just to add the course description and course learning outcomes - it’s a start! This blueprint process usually takes some time and contemplation, especially figuring out the unit learning outcomes and resources.\nLet’s move on to the next topic, where will address the next steps in the process, including creating content, activities and assessments.",

Some people also call this method ‘drinking from a fire hose’.\n\n\n7.16.2 Lucy and Ethel at the Chocolate Factory\n\n\n\n\n\n7.16.3 Predicting school in Y2K.\nOr, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France predicting what school would look like in the year 2000.

[/details]\nI’ve recently learned of Roy Amara and his ‘law’.\nRoy Amara - Oxford Reference\n!!!! We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\nI think it is fair to say that we tend to get pretty hyped about new technologies that promise to make our lives better, but actually don’t, while at the same time, we are somewhat blind to the negative effects of technology over longer periods of time. Feel free to push back against this idea (or not, it’s up to you).\nI’m not arguing that all technology is bad and that we need to return to ‘simpler’ times. I hope it is obvious to you that there are distinct advantages to using technology in education. There are many people who have a hard time learning and for them, technology can enable many activities that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. For example, if someone has difficulty processing written words, being able to have a screen-reader translate written words into spoken words can be extremely helpful. Or people who have difficulty writing or spelling can use a word processor to type and provide a spell-check. Or people who are learning a foreign language can use translators to help them understand complex ideas.\nWhat I will argue against, and, again, I encourage you to disagree with me, is the idea that technology is neutral. The simple fact that so much technology is built by rich white men who live in California, and who only want to make money should be a clue that the underlying philosophy behind the code that powers technology is fundamentally skewed towards benefitting rich white men.\nOne example of this in education technology is the use of Turnitin (TII). TII is a web service sold to schools (for tens of thousands of dollars) that they claim will help learners write better and will save faculty time in assessing learners’ work. They may be right, but what are the other messages sent when faculty rely on a black-box algorithm to determine which student has copied from another source legitimately and which student hasn’t?\n\n\n\n\n7.16.6 What Turnitin tells learners.\nLearners are not trustworthy.\nLearners must prove they are innocent before their work will be graded.\nLearners’ work can be given away to for-profit companies for free.\nWe can trust an invisible and inscrutable algorithm to accurately detect the difference between legitimate and illegitimate usage of other’s ideas.\nIt is more important to write so that you get a low TII number than it is to think deeply and carefully and write clearly.\nThe most important work that teaching faculty do, assessing student work and providing formative feedback, can be outsourced to the company with the lowest bid.\nSo on the surface, a service like TII seems like a benefit to both students and faculty, but if you look just a little closer, it is much less positive.\nIt is interesting to note that TII itself says specifically that their software cannot ever detect plagiarism, but that is how many faculty use it, to detect plagiarism.\nIf you want to read more about resisting TII, have a look at this article.\nA Guide for Resisting Edtech: the Case against Turnitin | Hybrid Pedagogy",

    "text": "7.18 Provocation\nDigital literacy has almost nothing to do with age and the idea of ‘digital natives’ (younger people being able to use technology more easily because they grew up with it) is the wrong way to think about digital literacy.\n\n7.18.1 Activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a short survey you can use to understand your learners’ contexts and access to web tools.\n[details=“Click to open”] Online Learning Readiness Survey\n[/details]\nIt is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital ‘natives’ and ‘immigrants’.\n===\nThe essential argument is that kids these days have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the kids. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article.\nDigital native\nAside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.\n\n\n\n\n7.18.2 Residents and Visitors\nI’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.\nAlternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it’s a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else’s blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present.\nAt the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.\nThe video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).\n\n\n\nI’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don’t spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).\nFor many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.\nA couple days ago one of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit.\nTechnology is not Pedagogy\nPlease take some time to engage in the following activity.\n\n\n7.18.3 Activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?\n[details=“Click to open”] Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice. Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a tool that falls into the ‘Professional-Resident’ quadrant for you and send me the link so I can add it to a feed. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others’ diagrams! Alternately, you can share a link in the Unit 4 Discussion forum. [/details]\nBefore I publish today’s post on Visitors and Residents, I want to think with you a little bit about why I like the approach of using a blog to communicate with learners.\nFirst, given the current situation, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to produce even one (let alone 3 or 4 for September, then another 3-4 for January) fully developed online course in time for September 2020. I don’t say this to discourage you, but to encourage you that there are methods of teaching online that don’t require a full learning design team to pull off successfully.\nI am using this blog (external to Moodle, then embedded) to compose my posts and updates this week, but you don’t need to do that. A perfectly acceptable alternative might be to use the Moodle forums, or especially the ‘Announcements’ forum in your course to post your updates. An advantage of the Announcements forum is that it automatically sends a notification to all of your learners that you have posted. It is worth noting, however, that learners cannot respond to the Announcements forum, so you would need to provide an alternate avenue of communication for those replies and questions.\nI also think it is valuable to be able to manage the flow of content and activities that learners receive. There are times when it is good to make sure everyone is thinking about the same thing for a few days. Spacing posts out to 2-3 times per week can be used to match the pace of a f2f class where content is released on a natural schedule. This can allow you to create a blueprint and syllabus at the outset, then make tweaks and adjustments as you work through the semester without having to make significant edits to already published materials. Also, if learners know that they can expect updates throughout the week, they may find it easier to stay on track with the work they are doing that particular week. On the other hand, there is also a reasonable argument to be made for having everything ready to go ahead of time and available for learners to truly work asynchronously on their own time and schedule.\nOne of the benefits of learning online is that it provides flexibility for both learners and faculty.",

    "text": "7.19 Developing Community in a Multi-Access Course\nIn order to build a Community of Reflection and Practice (the TOnE CORP), we encourage you to connect with a partner/group where you can support each other, discuss course design ideas, and collaborate. Here is a structure we will use in this course and which you are encouraged to replicate in your own courses.\n\nLearning Partners\nEach learner should identify one learning partner who will be their first contact when they have a question about the logistics of the course and expectations from the instructor. Your learning partner will be your ‘go-to’ person for all sorts of questions about due dates, assignment instructions, procedures, where to find resources, etc.\n\n\nLearning Pods\nEach set of learning partners will also connect with another set of learning partners to form a learning pod. Learning pods should meet regularly outside of our scheduled meeting times to discuss the course content. This is an opportunity for peer review of your individual work, questions about difficult concepts, and other content-related items.\n!! See Learning Pod Discussion Questions as a guide.\n\n\nRationale\nOne of the common complaints about remote learning is that both learners and faculty feel very isolated and alone. It is important to provide some structure to encourage learner-learner interactions. Faculty who have used this strategy report that comments show up in end of course ‘evaluations’ that learners, for the first time in their degree, made a friend because of this course structure. Social connections are critical for many learners. Furthermore, encouraging learners to review each others’ work is a cognitive task that encourages deep approaches to learning.\n!! Use the Sandstorm link below to find a learning partner and pod.\nSandstorm\n\n\n\n\n\n7.19.1 MS Word\nMS Word is likely the tool most people are familiar with and accustomed to using. TWU learners, faculty, and staff all have access provided to the entire MS Office 365 Suite through IT, so Word is a very compelling option for word processing.\nHowever, this is a thing…\n\nJsmdhyxnandialsbamalxusvahbxhcjnskal from r/memes\n\nMy point being that Word is grossly bloated software and tries to do too much.\ncanva.com\nh5p.org\npadlet.com\nVoicethread.com\n\n\n7.19.2 Course Workload Estimator\nCourse Workload Estimator - Rice University Center for Teaching Excellence\n\n\n7.19.3 Grav\nGrav is a flat-file content management system (CMS), meaning it doesn’t use a database, which makes it much more light-weight on the web. TWU courses for FAR Centres are rendered for the web in Grav.\n\n\n7.19.4 WordPress\nWordPress is likely the most popular CMS and website builder. WordPress can be used to increase learner agency in learning environments by allowing them to own, control, and host their own work on the web. WordPress is the software behind create.twu.ca which is available for all TWU learners, faculty, and staff.\n\n\n7.19.5 Moodle\nMoodle is a sub-category of CMSs often called a learning management system (LMS), or a virtual learning environment (VLE) if you are in the UK.\nMoodle is the LMS that TWU has used from the beginning of LMSs at TWU and currently lives at learn.twu.ca.\n\n\n7.19.6 atom.io\natom.io is a plain text editor that connects automagically to a Git repository, allowing for the creation of web content in a format called Markdown.\n\n\n7.19.7 Pages (macOS)\nPages is the default word processing software on macOS and comes bundled with all new Apple computers. Apple has simplified Pages over the years and learners who use Pages to create their documents need to export them to Word or PDF before submitting them as Pages documents cannot be opened on Windows or Linux computers.\n\n\n7.19.8 Scrivener\nScrivener is an app (macOS and Windows) dedicated to the writing process. It has a great many features that allow for significant planning and organizational workflows for writers.\n\n\n7.19.9 Etherpad\nEtherpad\n\n\n7.19.10 Priorities\nBefore recommending any specific apps for use in your courses, it is worthwhile to outline some priorities that we maintain with respect to our recommendations.\n\n\n7.19.11 SECTIONS\nTony Bates describes the SECTIONS Model for choosing technology or media in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nThe acronym stands for different considerations that come into play:\n\nStudents\nEase of use\nCost\nTeaching functions, including pedagogical affordances of media\nInteraction\nOrganizational Issues\nNetworking\nSecurity and privacy\n\nThe SECTIONS model is useful for thinking about technology at a macro level, but taken as a whole, it may not be terribly practical in an instructor’s everyday practice.\nIf you would like, you can read more at the link below.\nTeaching in a Digital Age - Second Edition\n\n\n7.19.12 Students\nOne excellent reminder from the SECTIONS model is that students are always the priority when thinking about technology, or, to be more precise, we need to start thinking about technology in education by thinking about what learners will do to meet the outcomes.\nShuell (1986) states the point nicely\nIf students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacher’s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. (p. 429) (emphasis added)\nPractically, that means that our recommendations should come from what you want your learners to be doing, and we don’t know that yet, so we have made some assumptions based on some of the things that we know help learners learn. I (Colin) think it is safe to assume that faculty at TWU generally want learners to engage in activities that reflect higher order cognitive skills (evaluating, applying, creating, building, imagining, interpreting, and yes, even understanding) as opposed to lower order cognitive skills (remembering, recognizing, duplicating, recalling, stating). This is most likely evidenced in your learning outcomes, and it is certainly reflected in the TWU Student Learning Outcomes.\nSo, before you think about using any given tool, please consider what you want learners to do. For example, if you want learners to interact with each other, how can you do that in a remote, asynchronous environment? What tools should you use? Is Zoom interactive with 4 people in a session? Is it interactive with 20 people? 100 people?\n\n\n\n\n\n7.19.13 Our priorities\n\n7.19.13.0.1 FLOSS\n\nBy LittleT889 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link\nActually, not that floss…\nFree/Libre Open Source Software has been a TWU priority for a long time as evidenced by our long-term use of Moodle as our learning management system.\nThere are very good reasons to prioritize FLOSS, even beyond the cost. Software like Moodle and WordPress have huge developer communities behind them because they are customizable and extensible with a huge ecosystem of plugins that provide functionality beyond what is available in the core.\nThis also means that there is no particular company that can disappear, leaving users high and dry. WikiSpaces is an example of a software company that attracted a huge number of educators and institutions to use its services, then they quit. Knewton is another example. Here are two articles:\nMeet The Mind-Reading Robo Tutor In The Sky\nThe second is from less than 5 years after the NPR article.\nKnewton Is Gone. The Larger Threat Remains | Just Visiting\nNot only is there a risk of small companies going out of business and leaving users stranded (this has happened at TWU), but there is also the issue of using proprietary tools that only produce files in their own proprietary formats.\n\n\n\n7.19.14 Portability\nThe key question here is whether you or your learners can export or otherwise take their work with you to another system. Proprietary software often restricts the ways in which you can move your information from one system to another.\n\n\n7.19.15 Ownership\nWho owns that data that is submitted to a given tool? If the author of the tool claims rights to learner work, we should not engage (see TurnItIn).\n\n\n7.19.16 SOLO Taxonomy\nIn light of the presumptive goal of higher order cognitive activities, the SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of a given learner’s or group’s response to a provocation. SOLO is an acronym for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it defines various levels of responses, as follows.\n\nHere is another conceptualization of the SOLO Taxonomy:\n\nBy Doug Belshaw, CC0, Link\nIf learners are providing responses at a pre- or uni-structural level in a university course, they are going to have a bad time. Multi-structural responses will likely lead to grades in the ‘C’ range. At minimum, responses should be unambiguously relational for a grade in the ‘B’ range and extended abstract for a grade in the ‘A’ range.\nThe TWU Standard Grading System describes ‘A’ work as\nOutstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)\nFor a ‘B’, here is what learners need to do:\nGood, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.\n\n\n7.19.17 Ummm…I’m here for the tools…\nHere is a good place to start…not with particular tools, but with particular activities.\nIDDblog: Instructional Design Tips, Advice, & Trends for Online & Distance Learning | Educational Technology and Online Course Design Help\nStanford’s matrix is getting plenty of traction in this time when so many are relying on Zoom to deliver content.\n\n\n\n\n\nAliquam nulla felis, fringilla nec lobortis a, faucibus a magna.

In response, we have developed a mini-course called Teaching ONline Effectively (TOnE) to help you think about and design the scenarios that we will be attending to in the Fall semester.\nThe course is designed intentionally to develop and nurture a Community of Reflection and Practice (CORP) and connect you with colleagues (inside and outside your department) who are working on many of the same issues as you will be. This structure of learning pods is a high impact teaching practice that we hope you will implement in your own courses.\nHere is an outline of the schedule that we intend to follow, beginning Tuesday, May 19, after the long weekend, and continuing for four weeks.\n\n\n8.2.3 Plenary meetings (11:00 am-12:00 noon):\nTues May 19 - Design Principles and Learner Contexts Mon May 25 - Activities and Assessments Mon June 01 - Building Community and Learning Pods Mon June 08 - Emergent Session\n\n\n8.2.4 Learning Pods\nDuring the week and at times that are suitable for your group, you are encouraged to meet synchronously to discuss your individual questions and challenges.\n\n\n8.2.5 Tech Talks (Fridays @ 11:00-11:30am)\nMay 22 - Moodle Set Up and Gradebook May 29 - Zoom and Microsoft Stream June 5 - Web-based Learning Activities June 12 - Library Resources: Curriculum Builder, Virtual Labs and Research Resources\nIf you can’t make the synchronous plenary sessions, don’t worry! We will be modeling Multi-Access by recording and making sessions available after the fact, including transcripts for those in low-bandwidth situations.\nPlease join our next ‘TOnE’ – Teaching Online Effectively session. We are pleased to invite you all to the course to participate as much as you are able during these challenging times.",

Sitting and listening? Discussing with peers? Reading and writing?\nWhat other ways can learners engage with the course content and with each other?\n!!! - Interview an expert !!! - Create a representation of a concept !!! - Draw a mind map !!! - Engage in a role play or case study !!! - Think-Pair-Share - and any number of pair/group discussion Activities !!! - Multi-media presentation (video, podcast, image gallery)\nActive learning is connected to other key models of learning, such as experiential learning, inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, constructivist learning and collaborative learning. These approaches all focus on students learning through doing and reflecting on the process.\nOne guiding model of Experiential Learning was developed in the 70’s by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.\n\nSource: The four steps in Kolb cycle. From Experiential Learning Theories by David Kolb. Wikipedia\n\n\nActive Learning & Ed Tech\nSometimes it seems like new ed tech apps pop up every day! Which are the most effective? What would help your students actively engage in your course and have a deeper understanding of your course outcomes?\nTake a look at the following videos in which our Instructional Designers, Mel and Karen, explain how to use the following apps:\n\nPowerPoint (or Google Slides)\nZoom and OneNote\nJamboard\nFlipgrip\nH5P\nMentimeter\nPadlet\n\nAs you watch, consider how a tech tool might facilitate active learning and critical reflection of your course content.\n\n\n\nPlease also check out our H5P site. It has a number of great ideas for promoting active learning in you course, such as:\n!!! - Interactive presentations / videos !!! - Quizzes !!! - Drag and Drop !!! - Interactive book !!! - Flashcards !!! - Branching Scenario !!! - Image Hotspots !!! - Accordion (great for breaking up long text)\n\n\nMore to Explore!\nCheck out the following resources on Active Learning:\n\nBest Practices: Active Learning\nSee the section on Active learning activity descriptions\nCenter for Educational Innovation from University of Minnesota (See Active Learning continuum and Making Time for Active Learning)\nWhat does learning look like?\nHow do we know our students have learned the course material?\nHow can we tell the level of understanding a student has of the course learning outcomes?\n\nWhen we incorporate Visible Learning strategies into our course design, it should become much more clear not only what students are learning, but how “deep” their understanding is of a concept.\n\n\nVisible Learning\nVisible Learning has received a lot of attention in recent years with John Hattie as a prominent figure. His 2008 meta-study, Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement seemed to present concrete data on what makes a difference in student’s learning. Although his methodology has a number of flaws (see Merhbi’s critique and Killian’s critique), it opens up discussion as to what teachers can do to enhance student learning (and what may not make much of a difference).\nIn Hattie’s The Applicability of Visible Learning to Higher Education he states: “To be successful, university teachers need to think of themselves as evaluators and ask about the merit, worth, and significance of the impact of their interventions—essentially, successful educators actively practice the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)” (80).\nHere is a summary of findings that have a high impact on learning:\n! When teachers believe their major role is to evaluate their impact; ! When teachers work together to know and evaluate their impact; ! When teachers base their teaching on students’ prior learning (what they bring to the lesson); ! When teachers explicitly inform the students about what success looks like near the start of a series of lessons; ! When teachers implement programs that have the optimal proportions of surface and deep learning; and ! When teachers set appropriate levels of challenge and never expect ‘do your best’.\nA key theme seems to be that instructors work together to evaluate their teaching strategies (so congratulations for those that participate in our TONE sessions!). Despite the questionable data of Hattie’s research, a key take-away could be that when we try various active learning strategies and students demonstrate their learning, a crucial step is to evaluate whether the activity had an impact.\n\n\nVisible Pedagogy\nConnected to visible learning is Visible Pedagogy where instructors make their pedagogy more visible to learners so learners can understand their intentions. An interesting read is Pete Wright’s Visible pedagogy and challenging inequity in school mathematics. Although the study focuses on high school math, there are certainly implications for Higher Education.\nAsk yourself,\n\nDo your students understand why you choose the teaching methods you use? (e.g. Do students value class discussions and learning from each other?)\nIs your reasoning behind your assignment choice implicit or explicit? (e.g. Do students value practicing APA formatting and realize the impact poor grammar may have in a professional context?)\n\n\n\nVisible Learning Strategies\nSo, what are some Visible Learning strategies you can try in your class? Here are some ideas:\n\nCritical Engagement of Course Materials:\nAllow learners to take ownership of their learning and engage in critical thinking\n\nHypothesis – allows learners to annotate their readings\nJigsaw method - students learn and teach material to others. See video for instructions.\n\n\n\nDocumentation of Learning\nHow will students show their learning?\n\nE-Portfolios, blogs, websites – allows students to create, curate, and present their learning\nSee examples of E-Portfolios\n\n\n\nDisseminate Learning\nAllow learners to collaborate and learn from each other.\n\nClass discussions (e.g. Moodle discussion forum. Also consider WordPress blog, and opening comments up to external experts in the field)\nPresentations (consider tech tools such as Flipgrid, (genially](https://genial.ly/))\nInterviews - bring in Storytelling\n\n\n\nFormative Practice\nUngraded learning activities allow students to practice and engage with concepts before they are assessed.\n\nLiberating Structures – unlock ideas!\nActive Learning Activities – such as Dotmocracy, Think-Pair-Share, Sticky Note Clustering\n\n\n\n\nMore to Explore!\nFor more ideas, see the following resources:\n\nLearning Activities page on our Course Design website.\nBass and Eynon’s Capturing the visible evidence of invisible learning (2009).\nSilvia Tolisano’s Langwitches website (see KWHLAQ and Thinking Routines)\nProject Zero from Harvard Graduate School of Education (see Thinking Routines)\n\n“The student will be able to understand the concepts in this course.”\nAs instructional designers, we often have discussions with instructors about their course learning outcomes. We try to tease of the meaning of the course by asking, “What are the Big Ideas and Essential Questions you want students to know and ask? We also want to ensure course learning outcomes are SMART.\n\nFor example, students understanding “the concepts in this course” is certainly not specific enough, so it helps to think of major course topics.\nAnother red flag for instructional designers is the term understand. It is the go-to verb when writing outcomes, but it is often not specific enough. To what extent do you want students to understand the material? Perhaps a surface understanding is appropriate, in which case define, describe, compare makes more sense.\nOr, you may want students to demonstrate critical thinking skills and attain a deeper understanding of the material. Apply, evaluate, infer, create - these verbs suggest a deeper understanding is required to meet the learning outcome.\n\n\nWhat is Deeper Learning?\nDeeper Learning involves higher order thinking skills and learning dispositions, such as reasoning, analyzing, problem-solving, and teamwork.\nWatch the following video for a brief explanation:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how do you promote deep learning in your class?\nThis is where activities such as Visible Learning routines and Liberating Structures can help. By guiding students through various problems, cases, questions, students can think critically and engage with the material, with each other, and with the instructor in a meaningful way.\n\nVisible Thinking Routines\nThis video explains Project Zero’s Visible Thinking Routines and highlight how the routines can facilitate deeper learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberating Structures\nSee our very own Barish Golland explaining Liberating Structures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore to Explore!\nFor more ideas, see the following resources:\n\nProject Zero from Harvard Graduate School of Education (see Thinking Routines)\nCh. 2 Surface and Deep Learning\nWhat is Deep Learning? from UNT Teaching Commons\nSurface and Deep Learning\nDesigning Deeper Learning Experiences for Online Instruction by Betul C.

[/details]\nI’ve recently learned of Roy Amara and his ‘law’.\nRoy Amara - Oxford Reference\n!!!! We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\nI think it is fair to say that we tend to get pretty hyped about new technologies that promise to make our lives better, but actually don’t, while at the same time, we are somewhat blind to the negative effects of technology over longer periods of time. Feel free to push back against this idea (or not, it’s up to you).\nI’m not arguing that all technology is bad and that we need to return to ‘simpler’ times. I hope it is obvious to you that there are distinct advantages to using technology in education. There are many people who have a hard time learning and for them, technology can enable many activities that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. For example, if someone has difficulty processing written words, being able to have a screen-reader translate written words into spoken words can be extremely helpful. Or people who have difficulty writing or spelling can use a word processor to type and provide a spell-check. Or people who are learning a foreign language can use translators to help them understand complex ideas.\nWhat I will argue against, and, again, I encourage you to disagree with me, is the idea that technology is neutral. The simple fact that so much technology is built by rich white men who live in California, and who only want to make money should be a clue that the underlying philosophy behind the code that powers technology is fundamentally skewed towards benefitting rich white men.\nOne example of this in education technology is the use of Turnitin (TII). TII is a web service sold to schools (for tens of thousands of dollars) that they claim will help learners write better and will save faculty time in assessing learners’ work. They may be right, but what are the other messages sent when faculty rely on a black-box algorithm to determine which student has copied from another source legitimately and which student hasn’t?\n\n\n\n\nWhat Turnitin tells learners.\nLearners are not trustworthy.\nLearners must prove they are innocent before their work will be graded.\nLearners’ work can be given away to for-profit companies for free.\nWe can trust an invisible and inscrutable algorithm to accurately detect the difference between legitimate and illegitimate usage of other’s ideas.\nIt is more important to write so that you get a low TII number than it is to think deeply and carefully and write clearly.\nThe most important work that teaching faculty do, assessing student work and providing formative feedback, can be outsourced to the company with the lowest bid.\nSo on the surface, a service like TII seems like a benefit to both students and faculty, but if you look just a little closer, it is much less positive.\nIt is interesting to note that TII itself says specifically that their software cannot ever detect plagiarism, but that is how many faculty use it, to detect plagiarism.\nIf you want to read more about resisting TII, have a look at this article.\nA Guide for Resisting Edtech: the Case against Turnitin | Hybrid Pedagogy",

    "text": "Provocation\nDigital literacy has almost nothing to do with age and the idea of ‘digital natives’ (younger people being able to use technology more easily because they grew up with it) is the wrong way to think about digital literacy.\n\nActivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a short survey you can use to understand your learners’ contexts and access to web tools.\n[details=“Click to open”] Online Learning Readiness Survey\n[/details]\nIt is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital ‘natives’ and ‘immigrants’.\n===\nThe essential argument is that kids these days have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the kids. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article.\nDigital native\nAside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.\n\n\n\n\nResidents and Visitors\nI’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.\nAlternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it’s a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else’s blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present.\nAt the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.\nThe video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).\n\n\n\nI’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don’t spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).\nFor many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.\nA couple days ago one of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit.\nTechnology is not Pedagogy\nPlease take some time to engage in the following activity.\n\n\nActivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?\n[details=“Click to open”] Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice.

[/details]\nBefore I publish today’s post on Visitors and Residents, I want to think with you a little bit about why I like the approach of using a blog to communicate with learners.\nFirst, given the current situation, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to produce even one (let alone 3 or 4 for September, then another 3-4 for January) fully developed online course in time for September 2020. I don’t say this to discourage you, but to encourage you that there are methods of teaching online that don’t require a full learning design team to pull off successfully.\nI am using this blog (external to Moodle, then embedded) to compose my posts and updates this week, but you don’t need to do that. A perfectly acceptable alternative might be to use the Moodle forums, or especially the ‘Announcements’ forum in your course to post your updates. An advantage of the Announcements forum is that it automatically sends a notification to all of your learners that you have posted. It is worth noting, however, that learners cannot respond to the Announcements forum, so you would need to provide an alternate avenue of communication for those replies and questions.\nI also think it is valuable to be able to manage the flow of content and activities that learners receive. There are times when it is good to make sure everyone is thinking about the same thing for a few days. Spacing posts out to 2-3 times per week can be used to match the pace of a f2f class where content is released on a natural schedule. This can allow you to create a blueprint and syllabus at the outset, then make tweaks and adjustments as you work through the semester without having to make significant edits to already published materials. Also, if learners know that they can expect updates throughout the week, they may find it easier to stay on track with the work they are doing that particular week. On the other hand, there is also a reasonable argument to be made for having everything ready to go ahead of time and available for learners to truly work asynchronously on their own time and schedule.\nOne of the benefits of learning online is that it provides flexibility for both learners and faculty.\nIn our 2 hour workshop, participates will engage in a few activities from Liberating Structures.

WordPress is the software behind create.twu.ca which is available for all TWU learners, faculty, and staff.\n\n\nMoodle\nMoodle is a sub-category of CMSs often called a learning management system (LMS), or a virtual learning environment (VLE) if you are in the UK.\nMoodle is the LMS that TWU has used from the beginning of LMSs at TWU and currently lives at learn.twu.ca.\n\n\natom.io\natom.io is a plain text editor that connects automagically to a Git repository, allowing for the creation of web content in a format called Markdown.\n\n\nPages (macOS)\nPages is the default word processing software on macOS and comes bundled with all new Apple computers. Apple has simplified Pages over the years and learners who use Pages to create their documents need to export them to Word or PDF before submitting them as Pages documents cannot be opened on Windows or Linux computers.\n\n\nScrivener\nScrivener is an app (macOS and Windows) dedicated to the writing process. It has a great many features that allow for significant planning and organizational workflows for writers.\n\n\nEtherpad\nEtherpad\n\n\nPriorities\nBefore recommending any specific apps for use in your courses, it is worthwhile to outline some priorities that we maintain with respect to our recommendations.\n\n\nSECTIONS\nTony Bates describes the SECTIONS Model for choosing technology or media in Teaching in a Digital Age.\nThe acronym stands for different considerations that come into play:\n\nStudents\nEase of use\nCost\nTeaching functions, including pedagogical affordances of media\nInteraction\nOrganizational Issues\nNetworking\nSecurity and privacy\n\nThe SECTIONS model is useful for thinking about technology at a macro level, but taken as a whole, it may not be terribly practical in an instructor’s everyday practice.\nIf you would like, you can read more at the link below.\nTeaching in a Digital Age - Second Edition\n\n\nStudents\nOne excellent reminder from the SECTIONS model is that students are always the priority when thinking about technology, or, to be more precise, we need to start thinking about technology in education by thinking about what learners will do to meet the outcomes.\nShuell (1986) states the point nicely\nIf students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacher’s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. (p. 429) (emphasis added)\nPractically, that means that our recommendations should come from what you want your learners to be doing, and we don’t know that yet, so we have made some assumptions based on some of the things that we know help learners learn. I (Colin) think it is safe to assume that faculty at TWU generally want learners to engage in activities that reflect higher order cognitive skills (evaluating, applying, creating, building, imagining, interpreting, and yes, even understanding) as opposed to lower order cognitive skills (remembering, recognizing, duplicating, recalling, stating). This is most likely evidenced in your learning outcomes, and it is certainly reflected in the TWU Student Learning Outcomes.\nSo, before you think about using any given tool, please consider what you want learners to do. For example, if you want learners to interact with each other, how can you do that in a remote, asynchronous environment? What tools should you use? Is Zoom interactive with 4 people in a session? Is it interactive with 20 people? 100 people?\n\n\n\n\n\nOur priorities\n\nFLOSS\n\nBy LittleT889 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link\nActually, not that floss…\nFree/Libre Open Source Software has been a TWU priority for a long time as evidenced by our long-term use of Moodle as our learning management system.\nThere are very good reasons to prioritize FLOSS, even beyond the cost. Software like Moodle and WordPress have huge developer communities behind them because they are customizable and extensible with a huge ecosystem of plugins that provide functionality beyond what is available in the core.\nThis also means that there is no particular company that can disappear, leaving users high and dry. WikiSpaces is an example of a software company that attracted a huge number of educators and institutions to use its services, then they quit. Knewton is another example. Here are two articles:\nMeet The Mind-Reading Robo Tutor In The Sky\nThe second is from less than 5 years after the NPR article.\nKnewton Is Gone. The Larger Threat Remains | Just Visiting\nNot only is there a risk of small companies going out of business and leaving users stranded (this has happened at TWU), but there is also the issue of using proprietary tools that only produce files in their own proprietary formats.\n\n\n\nPortability\nThe key question here is whether you or your learners can export or otherwise take their work with you to another system. Proprietary software often restricts the ways in which you can move your information from one system to another.\n\n\nOwnership\nWho owns that data that is submitted to a given tool? If the author of the tool claims rights to learner work, we should not engage (see TurnItIn).\n\n\nSOLO Taxonomy\nIn light of the presumptive goal of higher order cognitive activities, the SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of a given learner’s or group’s response to a provocation. SOLO is an acronym for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it defines various levels of responses, as follows.\n\nHere is another conceptualization of the SOLO Taxonomy:\n\nBy Doug Belshaw, CC0, Link\nIf learners are providing responses at a pre- or uni-structural level in a university course, they are going to have a bad time. Multi-structural responses will likely lead to grades in the ‘C’ range. At minimum, responses should be unambiguously relational for a grade in the ‘B’ range and extended abstract for a grade in the ‘A’ range.\nThe TWU Standard Grading System describes ‘A’ work as\nOutstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)\nFor a ‘B’, here is what learners need to do:\nGood, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.\n\n\nUmmm…I’m here for the tools…\nHere is a good place to start…not with particular tools, but with particular activities.\nIDDblog: Instructional Design Tips, Advice, & Trends for Online & Distance Learning | Educational Technology and Online Course Design Help\nStanford’s matrix is getting plenty of traction in this time when so many are relying on Zoom to deliver content.\n\n\n\n\n\nAliquam nulla felis, fringilla nec lobortis a, faucibus a magna.
