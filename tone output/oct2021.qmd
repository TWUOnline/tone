# Welcome to our TOnE Session: Active and Visible Pedagogy: Strategies for Deeper Learning! {.unnumbered}

In this two hour session, we explore some key ideas in designing effective activities and assessments for your course. We ask faculty to bring a ‘Wow! ‘ and a ‘Wonder?' from your teaching practice – something that's worked well to engage your learners, and something you wonder about. Our focus is on small group activities to give you the chance to explore and question engagement strategies that are meaningful to you.

! Date: October 28th OR October 29th 9am-11am
! **Campus Location**: Glass Room, Norma Marion Alloway Library
! **Zoom**: See email invitation for the Zoom link

- ...[what do YOU want to know?]
- What does an online community of inquiry look like?
- How can I build a sense of community in a remote course?


## Provocations

Face-to-face interaction, whether mediated through the web or not, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development and growth of transformative communities of inquiry


### What is Active Learning?

A key approach in course design is **Active Learning** - learning by **DOING**.

As you design your lessons, consider what your students are *doing*. Sitting and listening? Discussing with peers? Reading and writing?

What other ways can learners engage with the course content and with each other?

!!! - Interview an expert
!!! - Create a representation of a concept
!!! - Draw a mind map
!!! - Engage in a role play or case study
!!! - Think-Pair-Share - and any number of pair/group discussion Activities
!!! - Multi-media presentation (video, podcast, image gallery)

Active learning is connected to other key models of learning, such as experiential learning, inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, constructivist learning and collaborative learning. These approaches all focus on students learning through ***doing*** and ***reflecting*** on the process.

One guiding model of **Experiential Learning** was developed in the 70's by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.

### Active Learning & Ed Tech

Sometimes it seems like new ed tech apps pop up every day! Which are the most effective? What would help your students actively engage in your course and have a deeper understanding of your course outcomes?

Take a look at the following videos in which our Instructional Designers, Mel and Karen, explain how to use the following apps:

- PowerPoint (or Google Slides)
- Zoom and OneNote
- Jamboard
- Flipgrip
- H5P
- Mentimeter
- Padlet

As you watch, consider how a tech tool might facilitate active learning and critical reflection of your course content.

Please also check out our [H5P site](https://create.twu.ca/h5p/){target="_blank"}. It has a number of great ideas for promoting active learning in you course, such as:

!!! - Interactive presentations / videos
!!! - Quizzes
!!! - Drag and Drop
!!! - Interactive book
!!! - Flashcards
!!! - Branching Scenario
!!! - Image Hotspots
!!! - Accordion (great for breaking up long text)

- What does learning look like?
- How do we know our students have learned the course material?
- How can we tell the level of understanding a student has of the course learning outcomes?

When we incorporate Visible Learning strategies into our course design, it should become much more clear not only what students are learning, but how "deep" their understanding is of a concept.


### Visible Learning

Visible Learning has received a lot of attention in recent years with John Hattie as a prominent figure. His 2008 meta-study, Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement seemed to present concrete data on what makes a difference in student's learning. Although his methodology has a number of flaws (see [Merhbi's critique](https://www.evidencebasedteaching.org.au/wp-content/uploads/An-Objective-Critique-of-Hatties-Visible-Learning-Research.pdf){target="_blank"} and [Killian's critique](https://www.evidencebasedteaching.org.au/wp-content/uploads/An-Objective-Critique-of-Hatties-Visible-Learning-Research.pdf){target="_blank"}), it opens up discussion as to what teachers can do to enhance student learning (and what may not make much of a difference).

In Hattie's The Applicability of Visible Learning to Higher Education he states: "To be successful, university teachers need to think of themselves as evaluators and ask about the merit, worth, and significance of the impact of their interventions—essentially, successful educators actively practice the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)" (80).

Here is a summary of findings that have a high impact on learning:

!  When teachers believe their major role is to **evaluate their impact**;
!  When teachers **work together** to know and evaluate their impact;
!  When teachers base their teaching on students' **prior learning** (what they bring to the lesson);
!  When teachers explicitly inform the students about **what success looks like** near the start of a series of lessons;
!  When teachers implement programs that have the optimal proportions of surface and **deep learning**; and
!  When teachers set appropriate levels of **challenge** and never expect ‘do your best'.

A key theme seems to be that instructors work together to evaluate their teaching strategies (so congratulations for those that participate in our TONE sessions!). Despite the questionable data of Hattie's research, a key take-away could be that when we try various active learning strategies and students demonstrate their learning, a crucial step is to evaluate whether the activity had an impact.


### Visible Pedagogy

Connected to visible learning is **Visible Pedagogy** where instructors make their pedagogy more visible to learners so learners can understand their intentions. An interesting read is Pete Wright's [Visible pedagogy and challenging inequity in school mathematics](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02421688/document){target="_blank"}. Although the study focuses on high school math, there are certainly implications for Higher Education.

Ask yourself,

- Do your students understand why you choose the teaching methods you use? (e.g. Do students value class discussions and learning from each other?)
- Is your reasoning behind your assignment choice implicit or explicit? (e.g. Do students value practicing APA formatting and realize the impact poor grammar may have in a professional context?)


### Visible Learning Strategies

So, what are some Visible Learning strategies you can try in your class? Here are some ideas:


##### Critical Engagement of Course Materials:

*Allow learners to take ownership of their learning and engage in critical thinking*

- Hypothesis – allows learners to annotate their readings
- Jigsaw method - students learn and teach material to others. See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euhtXUgBEts) for instructions.


##### Documentation of Learning

*How will students show their learning?*

- E-Portfolios, blogs, websites – allows students to create, curate, and present their learning
- See [examples of E-Portfolios](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/resources/integrative-learning/eportfolios/examples-student-eportfolios){target="_blank"}


##### Disseminate Learning

*Allow learners to collaborate and learn from each other.*

- Class discussions (e.g. Moodle discussion forum. Also consider WordPress blog, and opening comments up to external experts in the field)
- Presentations (consider tech tools such as [Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com/){target="_blank"}, (genially](https://genial.ly/))
- Interviews - bring in Storytelling


##### Formative Practice

*Ungraded learning activities allow students to practice and engage with concepts before they are assessed.*

- [Active Learning Activities](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/developing-assignments/assignment-design/active-learning-activities){target="_blank"} – such as Dotmocracy, Think-Pair-Share, Sticky Note Clustering

- Bass and Eynon's [Capturing the visible evidence of invisible learning](http://www.academiccommons.org/2014/10/13/capturing-the-visible-evidence-of-invisible-learning/){target="_blank"} (2009).
- Silvia Tolisano's Langwitches website (see [KWHLAQ](http://langwitches.org/blog/2020/01/09/upgrade-your-kwl-chart-to-the-21st-century-tools-platforms-and-visible-thinking-routines/){target="_blank"} and [Thinking Routines](http://langwitches.org/blog/2015/01/11/from-visible-thinking-routines-to-5-modern-learning-routines/">Thinking Routines){target="_blank"})
- Project Zero from Harvard Graduate School of Education (see [Thinking Routines](http://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines">Thinking Routines){target="_blank"})

"The student will be able to understand the concepts in this course."

As instructional designers, we often have discussions with instructors about their course learning outcomes. We try to tease of the meaning of the course by asking, "What are the ***Big Ideas*** and ***Essential Questions*** you want students to know and ask? We also want to ensure course learning outcomes are SMART.

![](assets/oct2021/SMART-goals.png){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

For example, students understanding "the concepts in this course" is certainly not specific enough, so it helps to think of major course topics.

Another red flag for instructional designers is the term ***understand***. It is the go-to verb when writing outcomes, but it is often not specific enough. To what extent do you want students to understand the material? Perhaps a surface understanding is appropriate, in which case ***define, describe, compare*** makes more sense.

Or, you may want students to demonstrate critical thinking skills and attain a deeper understanding of the material. ***Apply, evaluate, infer, create*** - these verbs suggest a deeper understanding is required to meet the learning outcome.


### What is Deeper Learning?

Deeper Learning involves higher order thinking skills and learning dispositions, such as reasoning, analyzing, problem-solving, and teamwork.

Watch the following video for a brief explanation:

### So how do you promote deep learning in your class?

This is where activities such as Visible Learning routines and Liberating Structures can help. By guiding students through various problems, cases, questions, students can think critically and engage with the material, with each other, and with the instructor in a meaningful way.

# Welcome to Unit 4! {.unnumbered}

You have likely noticed by now that this unit looks a bit different from the previous three units, and that is by design. Our intent in shifting to a different format is to show you different formats and course structures in multi-access learning environments.

The remaining units will demonstrate one way to reduce your reliance on web-conferencing (Zoom, BlueJeans, Skype...) when providing direct instruction for learners in your course. As we have all experienced as we finished the Spring 2020 semester, web-conferencing is exhausting! It is not a good replacement for a lecture, it is difficult for instructors, and it is difficult for learners. For some learners (and instructors), it is impossible due to sketchy or limited bandwidth internet connections at home, or to extreme differences in time-zones.

Web-conferencing certainly helped get us through March and April, so this is not to denigrate those who needed it, but it is important to recognize that March and April 2020 in higher ed were far less than ideal.

So for this week, we are going to focus on a primarily asynchronous, low-bandwidth mode of communication supplemented with more casual and unstructured synchronous meetings.

Below this post, you will see what is called a 'feed' which is essentially a subscription to a blog. Each time I publish a post, that post will show up at the top of the feed. Each post will outline some new content and resources for that topic. You will also notice posts from the Library and other faculty at TWU.

Although I am using a blog to keep you all up-to-date, you can do the same thing with a list of emails.

!!!! If you have your own blog and would like to respond to the reflection prompts for this week on your own blog, send me the URL and I will create another feed of participant posts.

There are a wide variety of possible learning environments in both F2F and online contexts. You might be familiar with Ferris Bueller's economics teacher in the 1986 movie *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*.

Or, perhaps, you are familiar with this scene from the 1950s, which might be analogous to some teachers who simply throw everything at their learners in a way that is far too fast for their learners to process. Some people also call this method 'drinking from a fire hose'.

### Predicting school in Y2K.

Or, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France predicting what school would look like in the year 2000. Perhaps Cote was only off by about 20 years in his prediction!

[![France in XXI Century. School](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg/512px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg "Jean Marc Cote (if 1901) or Villemard (if 1910)

### University in 1350

Perhaps you recognize this scene depicting a university lecture in 1350 in Bologna.

[![Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg/1200px-Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg#/media/File:Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg)

I hope it is obvious to you that not all teaching and learning environments are actually conducive to learning or to building a community. Whether a teacher is putting their learners to sleep, or forcing too much content, or trying to rely on a techno-magical solution, there are problems with all of the learning environments shown above.

Here is my bold and provocative statement for this post...

! Face-to-face interaction, whether mediated through the web or not, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development and growth of transformative communities of inquiry.

I've recently learned of Roy Amara and his 'law'.

[Roy Amara - Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00018679)



!!!! We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

I think it is fair to say that we tend to get pretty hyped about new technologies that promise to make our lives better, but actually don't, while at the same time, we are somewhat blind to the negative effects of technology over longer periods of time. Feel free to push back against this idea (or not, it's up to you).

I'm `not` arguing that all technology is bad and that we need to return to 'simpler' times. I hope it is obvious to you that there are distinct advantages to using technology in education. There are many people who have a hard time learning and for them, technology can enable many activities that wouldn't otherwise be possible. For example, if someone has difficulty processing written words, being able to have a screen-reader translate written words into spoken words can be extremely helpful. Or people who have difficulty writing or spelling can use a word processor to type and provide a spell-check. Or people who are learning a foreign language can use translators to help them understand complex ideas.

What I will argue against, and, again, I encourage you to disagree with me, is the idea that `technology is neutral`. The simple fact that so much technology is built by rich white men who live in California, and who only want to make money should be a clue that the underlying philosophy behind the code that powers technology is fundamentally skewed towards benefitting rich white men.

One example of this in education technology is the use of Turnitin (TII). TII is a web service sold to schools (for tens of thousands of dollars) that they claim will help learners write better and will save faculty time in assessing learners' work. They may be right, but what are the other messages sent when faculty rely on a `black-box algorithm` to determine which student has copied from another source legitimately and which student hasn't?

:::


### What Turnitin tells learners.

Learners are not trustworthy.   
 Learners must prove they are innocent before their work will be graded.   
 Learners' work can be given away to for-profit companies for free.   
 We can trust an invisible and inscrutable algorithm to accurately detect the difference between legitimate and illegitimate usage of other's ideas.   
 It is more important to write so that you get a low TII number than it is to think deeply and carefully and write clearly.   
 The most important work that teaching faculty do, assessing student work and providing formative feedback, can be outsourced to the company with the lowest bid.

So on the surface, a service like TII seems like a benefit to both students and faculty, but if you look just a little closer, it is much less positive.

It is interesting to note that TII itself says specifically that their software cannot ever detect plagiarism, but that is how many faculty use it, to detect plagiarism.

If you want to read more about resisting TII, have a look at this article.

## Key Questions

- ...[what do YOU want to know?]
- Are you a digital resident or visitor?
- How can technology help us start with community and relationship vs. content and mastery.


## Provocation

Digital literacy has almost nothing to do with age and the idea of 'digital natives' (younger people being able to use technology more easily because they grew up with it) is the wrong way to think about digital literacy.


### Activity:

::: {.learning-activity}

Here is a short survey you can use to understand your learners' contexts and access to web tools.

[details="Click to open"]
[Online Learning Readiness Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/73HZ3GS)



[/details]

It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

===

The essential argument is that *kids these days* have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

[Digital native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native)



Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.

:::


### Residents and Visitors

I'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where *you* reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it's a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else's blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor <--> resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal <--> professional continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).

I've shared my VR Diagram below...keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.

![alt-text](assets/oct2021/vr-diagram.png "Visitor-Resident Diagram"){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don't spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).

For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn't determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.

A couple days ago one of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit.

[Technology is not Pedagogy](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/technology-is-not-pedagogy/)



Please take some time to engage in the following activity.


### Activity:

::: {.learning-activity}

I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?

[details="Click to open"]
 Read [ Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171){target="_blank"}
 Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice.
 Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a tool that falls into the 'Professional-Resident' quadrant for you and send me the link so I can add it to a feed. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others' diagrams!
 Alternately, you can share a link in the Unit 4 Discussion forum.
[/details]

Before I publish today's post on Visitors and Residents, I want to think with you a little bit about why I like the approach of using a blog to communicate with learners.

First, given the current situation, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to produce even one (let alone 3 or 4 for September, then another 3-4 for January) fully developed online course in time for September 2020. I don't say this to discourage you, but to encourage you that there are methods of teaching online that don't require a full learning design team to pull off successfully.

I am using this blog (external to Moodle, then embedded) to compose my posts and updates this week, but you don't need to do that. A perfectly acceptable alternative might be to use the Moodle forums, or especially the 'Announcements' forum in your course to post your updates. An advantage of the Announcements forum is that it automatically sends a notification to all of your learners that you have posted. It is worth noting, however, that learners cannot respond to the Announcements forum, so you would need to provide an alternate avenue of communication for those replies and questions.

I also think it is valuable to be able to manage the flow of content and activities that learners receive. There are times when it is good to make sure everyone is thinking about the same thing for a few days. Spacing posts out to 2-3 times per week can be used to match the pace of a f2f class where content is released on a natural schedule. This can allow you to create a blueprint and syllabus at the outset, then make tweaks and adjustments as you work through the semester without having to make significant edits to already published materials. Also, if learners know that they can expect updates throughout the week, they may find it easier to stay on track with the work they are doing that particular week. On the other hand, there is also a reasonable argument to be made for having everything ready to go ahead of time and available for learners to truly work asynchronously on their own time and schedule.

One of the benefits of learning online is that it provides flexibility for both learners and faculty.

### MS Word

MS Word is likely the tool most people are familiar with and accustomed to using. TWU learners, faculty, and staff all have access provided to the entire MS Office 365 Suite through IT, so Word is a very compelling option for word processing.

However, this is a thing...

> [Jsmdhyxnandialsbamalxusvahbxhcjnskal](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ffwgxh/jsmdhyxnandialsbamalxusvahbxhcjnskal/) from [r/memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/memes)

My point being that Word is grossly bloated software and tries to do too much.

### Course Workload Estimator

[Course Workload Estimator - Rice University Center for Teaching Excellence](https://cte.rice.edu/workload)


### Grav

[Grav](https://getgrav.org){target="_blank"} is a *flat-file* content management system (CMS), meaning it doesn't use a database, which makes it much more light-weight on the web. TWU courses for FAR Centres are rendered for the web in Grav.


### WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org){target="_blank"} is likely the most popular CMS and website builder. WordPress can be used to increase learner agency in learning environments by allowing them to own, control, and host their own work on the web. WordPress is the software behind [create.twu.ca](https://create.twu.ca){target="_blank"} which is available for all TWU learners, faculty, and staff.


### Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.org){target="_blank"} is a sub-category of CMSs often called a learning management system (LMS), or a virtual learning environment (VLE) if you are in the UK.

Moodle is the LMS that TWU has used from the beginning of LMSs at TWU and currently lives at [learn.twu.ca](https://learn.twu.ca){target="_blank"}.


### atom.io

[atom.io](https://atom.io){target="_blank"} is a plain text editor that connects automagically to a Git repository, allowing for the creation of web content in a format called Markdown.


### Pages (macOS)

Pages is the default word processing software on macOS and comes bundled with all new Apple computers. Apple has simplified Pages over the years and learners who use Pages to create their documents need to export them to Word or PDF before submitting them as Pages documents cannot be opened on Windows or Linux computers.


### Scrivener

[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview){target="_blank"} is an app (macOS and Windows) dedicated to the writing *process*. It has a great many features that allow for significant planning and organizational workflows for writers.


### Etherpad

[Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/)


### Priorities

Before recommending any specific apps for use in your courses, it is worthwhile to outline some priorities that we maintain with respect to our recommendations.


### SECTIONS

Tony Bates describes the SECTIONS Model for choosing technology or media in Teaching in a Digital Age.

The acronym stands for different considerations that come into play:

- Students
- Ease of use
- Cost
- Teaching functions, including pedagogical affordances of media
- Interaction
- Organizational Issues
- Networking
- Security and privacy

The SECTIONS model is useful for thinking about technology at a macro level, but taken as a whole, it may not be terribly practical in an instructor's everyday practice.

If you would like, you can read more at the link below.

[Teaching in a Digital Age - Second Edition](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/9-2-the-sections-model/)


### Students

One excellent reminder from the SECTIONS model is that students are always the priority when thinking about technology, or, to be more precise, we need to start thinking about technology in education by thinking about what learners will `do` to meet the outcomes.

Shuell (1986) states the point nicely

If students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacher's fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that `what the student does is more important than what the teacher does`. (p. 429) (emphasis added)

Practically, that means that our recommendations should come from what you want your learners to be doing, and we don't know that yet, so we have made some assumptions based on some of the things that we know help learners learn. I (Colin) think it is safe to assume that faculty at TWU generally want learners to engage in activities that reflect higher order cognitive skills (evaluating, applying, creating, building, imagining, interpreting, and yes, even understanding) as opposed to lower order cognitive skills (remembering, recognizing, duplicating, recalling, stating). This is most likely evidenced in your learning outcomes, and it is certainly [reflected in the TWU Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes){target="_blank"}.

So, before you think about using any given tool, please consider what you want learners to do. For example, if you want learners to interact with each other, how can you do that in a remote, asynchronous environment? What tools should you use? Is Zoom interactive with 4 people in a session? Is it interactive with 20 people? 100 people?

### Our priorities


##### FLOSS

[![Floss (dance).gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Floss_%28dance%29.gif)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Floss_(dance).gif#/media/File:Floss_(dance).gif)

Actually, not that floss...

Free/Libre Open Source Software has been a TWU priority for a long time as evidenced by our long-term use of Moodle as our learning management system.

There are very good reasons to prioritize FLOSS, even beyond the cost. Software like Moodle and WordPress have huge developer communities behind them because they are customizable and extensible with a huge ecosystem of plugins that provide functionality beyond what is available in the core.

This also means that there is no particular company that can disappear, leaving users high and dry. WikiSpaces is an example of a software company that attracted a huge number of educators and institutions to use its services, [then they quit.](https://wikispaces.com/){target="_blank"} Knewton is another example. Here are two articles:

[Meet The Mind-Reading Robo Tutor In The Sky](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/13/437265231/meet-the-mind-reading-robo-tutor-in-the-sky)



The second is from less than 5 years after the NPR article.

[Knewton Is Gone. The Larger Threat Remains | Just Visiting](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/knewton-gone-larger-threat-remains?utm_source=Academica+Top+Ten&utm_campaign=62fac2c01a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_07_04_40&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b4928536cf-62fac2c01a-51939269)

Not only is there a risk of small companies going out of business and leaving users stranded (this has happened at TWU), but there is also the issue of using proprietary tools that only produce files in their own proprietary formats.


### Portability

The key question here is whether you or your learners can export or otherwise take their work with you to another system. Proprietary software often restricts the ways in which you can move your information from one system to another.


### Ownership

Who owns that data that is submitted to a given tool? If the author of the tool claims rights to learner work, we should not engage (see TurnItIn).


### SOLO Taxonomy

In light of the presumptive goal of higher order cognitive activities, the SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of a given learner's or group's response to a provocation. SOLO is an acronym for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it defines various levels of responses, as follows.

![](assets/oct2021/SOLOTaxonomy.jpg){fig-alt="" .lightbox}

Here is another conceptualization of the SOLO Taxonomy:

[![Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) Taxonomy.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_%28SOLO%29_Taxonomy.png/1200px-Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_%28SOLO%29_Taxonomy.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_(SOLO)\_Taxonomy.png#/media/File:Structure_of_Observed_Learning_Outcomes_(SOLO)\_Taxonomy.png)  
By [Doug Belshaw](//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dajbelshaw&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Dajbelshaw (page does not exist)"), [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en "Creative Commons Zero, Public Domain Dedication"), [Link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=60807631)

If learners are providing responses at a `pre- or uni-structural` level in a university course, they are going to have a bad time. `Multi-structural` responses will likely lead to grades in the 'C' range. At minimum, responses should be `unambiguously relational` for a grade in the 'B' range and `extended abstract` for a grade in the 'A' range.

The [TWU Standard Grading System describes 'A' work as](https://www.twu.ca/about/university-standard-grading-system){target="_blank"}

Outstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)

For a 'B', here is what learners need to do:

Good, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.


### Ummm...I'm here for the tools...

Here is a good place to start...not with particular tools, but with particular activities.
