In our 2 hour workshop, participates will engage in a few activities from [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/ls-menu).  These structured activities help us unlock key ideas, remove barriers in conversation, and solve problems with a collaborative approach.

Feel free to follow along with our presentation.
