When we incorporate Visible Learning strategies into our course design, it should become much more clear not only what students are learning, but how “deep” their understanding is of a concept.

### Visible Learning
Visible Learning has received a lot of attention in recent years with John Hattie as a prominent figure.  His 2008 meta-study, Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement seemed to present concrete data on what makes a difference in student’s learning.  Although his methodology has a number of flaws (see [Merhbi’s critique](https://www.evidencebasedteaching.org.au/wp-content/uploads/An-Objective-Critique-of-Hatties-Visible-Learning-Research.pdf) and [Killian’s critique](https://www.evidencebasedteaching.org.au/wp-content/uploads/An-Objective-Critique-of-Hatties-Visible-Learning-Research.pdf)), it opens up discussion as to what teachers can do to enhance student learning (and what may not make much of a difference).

In Hattie’s The Applicability of Visible Learning to Higher Education he states: “To be successful, university teachers need to think of themselves as evaluators and ask about the merit, worth, and significance of the impact of their interventions—essentially, successful educators actively practice the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)” (80).

Here is a summary of findings that have a high impact on learning:  

! :fa-check: When teachers believe their major role is to **evaluate their impact**;  
! :fa-check: When teachers **work together** to know and evaluate their impact;  
! :fa-check: When teachers base their teaching on students’ **prior learning** (what they bring to the lesson);  
! :fa-check: When teachers explicitly inform the students about **what success looks like** near the start of a series of lessons;  
! :fa-check: When teachers implement programs that have the optimal proportions of surface and **deep learning**; and  
! :fa-check: When teachers set appropriate levels of **challenge** and never expect ‘do your best’.  

A key theme seems to be that instructors work together to evaluate their teaching strategies (so congratulations for those that participate in our TONE sessions!).  Despite the questionable data of Hattie’s research, a key take-away could be that when we try various active learning strategies and students demonstrate their learning, a crucial step is to evaluate whether the activity had an impact.

### Visible Pedagogy
Connected to visible learning is **Visible Pedagogy** where instructors make their pedagogy more visible to learners so learners can understand their intentions.  An interesting read is Pete Wright's [Visible pedagogy and challenging inequity in school mathematics](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02421688/document). Although the study focuses on high school math, there are certainly implications for Higher Education.

Ask yourself,
- Do your students understand why you choose the teaching methods you use? (e.g. Do students value class discussions and learning from each other?)
- Is your reasoning behind your assignment choice implicit or explicit? (e.g. Do students value practicing APA formatting and realize the impact poor grammar may have in a professional context?)

### Visible Learning Strategies
So, what are some Visible Learning strategies you can try in your class?  Here are some ideas:

##### Critical Engagement of Course Materials:
*Allow learners to take ownership of their learning and engage in critical thinking*
- Hypothesis – allows learners to annotate their readings
- Jigsaw method - students learn and teach material to others.  See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euhtXUgBEts) for instructions.

##### Documentation of Learning
*How will students show their learning?*
- E-Portfolios, blogs, websites – allows students to create, curate, and present their learning
- See [examples of E-Portfolios](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/resources/integrative-learning/eportfolios/examples-student-eportfolios)

##### Disseminate Learning
*Allow learners to collaborate and learn from each other.*
- Class discussions (e.g. Moodle discussion forum.  Also consider WordPress blog, and opening comments up to external experts in the field)
- Presentations (consider tech tools such as [Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com/), (genially](https://genial.ly/))
- Interviews - bring in Storytelling

##### Formative Practice
*Ungraded learning activities allow students to practice and engage with concepts before they are assessed.*

- [Active Learning Activities](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/developing-assignments/assignment-design/active-learning-activities) – such as Dotmocracy, Think-Pair-Share, Sticky Note Clustering
