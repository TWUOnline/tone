# Course Modalities

We begin this unit by investigating some terminology you may have heard when people start talking about online learning:

'Hybrid', 'blended', 'hyflex', 'blended-sync', 'multi-access', 'flipped', 'bi-synchronous', 'synchro-modal'...oh my!

Don't worry if you are having difficulty making sense of any of the terms used to describe the various ways instructors or programs choose to deliver their courses. There has been a lack of consensus, or even consistency, on terminology for a long time. In the old days when instructors first started tinkering with using the web to deliver courses, there were two options, 'face-to-face' (lectures) and 'online' (text-based). Face-to-face was what we all know and understand and was delivered synchronously. Online, however, was very slow, relying on IRC and similar 'chat' services or email listservs, and was therefore, asynchronous. This asynchronicity likely led traditional instructors to view online learning with some suspicion due to the resemblance to 'correspondence education' where course materials were delivered back and forth between instructors and learners via the post office, often with weeks of delay.

Another source of confusion in the area is the conflation of pedagogy with modality. Pedagogy refers to the ways that learning is structured, the activities that learners engage in, and the assessment strategies used to infer a grade. Modality usually refers to the time and the place that those interactions occur. So the pedagogical strategy of having learners debate a topic can occur in any modality (synchronous/co-located, synchronous/remote, asynchronous/co-located or asynchronous/remote). It is important to remember that teaching and learning in a particular modality (online or face-to-face) does not necessarily determine a particular pedagogy.

Irvine (2020) argues that the pedagogy employed in a small face-to-face class can be either dynamic, interactive, and highly engaging, or it can be static, one-way transmission of factoids. Similarly online; if the pedagogical orientation prioritizes one-way transmission of content, chances are high that learners will have more difficulty engaging than if it is dynamic and interactive.

When thinking about pedagogy in different modalities, differences become apparent quite quickly. Going back to the example of a debate, we are all most likely familiar with in-person debates with oral arguments for and against a proposition, followed by rebuttals and so on. This often happens over the course of a couple of hours as the debaters present their prepared arguments and statements. While this model can make for compelling viewing in-person, it is completely ephemeral outside sophisticated recording equipment, and once it is recorded, the files (or physical tapes) involved (audio and video) are very large and cumbersome. On the other hand, it is relatively easy for a moderator to explain the rules of the debate to the debaters and the audience, and also to respond to questions in the moment to clarify any concerns.

Moving that same activity to an asynchronous, text-based environment has implications for how the activity unfolds. The content preparation remains the same in that both parties prepare their arguments ahead of time. However, the logistics of the activity change and require everything to be planned and written down ahead of time. The presentation of arguments also takes much longer as there is always a delay between sending and receiving a message.

One way to think about the differences in modalities is to consider who is left out in different modalities. For example, in a face-to-face environment, those learners who are quieter and less likely to speak are often excluded from the class conversations because they need time to process information before formulating a response. This represents a significant loss of valuable input in the discourse and also missed learning opportunities as these learners have less opportunity to have their ideas refined and misconceptions corrected. Conversely, in remote modalities, those whose internet bandwidth is limited will experience the same type of exclusion whether they have something to contribute or not. At the same time, those quieter learners have the opportunity to pause and reflect on others' contributions before drafting a response, then consider their words, revise, and finally contribute to the commons. This opportunity to time-delay responses often leads to a much richer and deeper discourse with the added benefit that anyone can revisit the record at any time.

TWU, in looking forward to emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, is recommending a specific combination of modalities that most closely match definitions of both 'hybrid' and 'blended' in the research. By using a combination of modalities where 50% of course 'contact time' occurs face-to-face and the remaining 50% is asynchronous, TWU can maximize the use of campus space, accommodate more learners. This suggestion brings with it implications for how instructors think about planning for courses.

The place to begin is undoubtedly representative of a significant lift in terms of workload, but the short-term cost will lead to many long-term benefits, regardless of the modality. We recommend that your starting place should be to prepare your entire course so that it could be delivered asynchronously, likely in a primarily text format. For many, this may mean editing and revising transcripts from recorded Zoom sessions from 2020, or it may mean exporting your slide decks to an outline in a word processor and then filling in details with commentary like the posts in TOnE21.

[ui-accordion-item title="An aside about slide decks..."]

Whether you use PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, or another slide generating tool, your slide decks are less helpful than you realize. Most often, slide decks must be downloaded from the web, opened in another program, and then navigated through one slide at a time. This creates unnecessary barriers to interacting with your content, limiting accessiblity for those who use screenreaders. It is much easier for learners to navigate through a well-structured webpage with heading levels replacing bullets on a slide.

In fact, Edward Tufte (2006) argues that the overuse of Powerpoint led to the deaths of the space shuttle Columbia's crew and cites the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report:

> As information gets passed up an organization hierarchy, from people who do analysis to mid-level managers to high-level leadership, *key explanations and supporting information are filtered out*. In this context, it is easy to understand how a senior manager might read this PowerPoint slide and not realize that it addresses a life-threatening situation.

> At many points during its investigation, the Board was surprised to receive similar presentation slides from NASA officials in place of technical reports. The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA." (emphasis added)

Ultimately, slide decks are designed to support live verbal presentations, not web-based reading. TWU GLOBAL Online instructional designers try to avoid slide decks whenever possible.

### Suggested Activities for Discussion and Reflection

!!!! Note: these activities are NOT required! Please consider your own workload and mental health and don't worry if you can't respond.  
!!!!:fa-check: Compose and share a blog post where you consider something in this post that you find particularly challenging or inspiring.  
!!!! :fa-check: Respond to the same prompt above but in the discussion forum in Moodle.  
!!!! :fa-check: Have a conversation in your learning pod about the affordances of hybrid or blended learning environments, particularly the 50/50 blend that TWU is recommending, then reflect on the conversation in a blog or forum post.
