### What is Active Learning?
A key approach in course design is **Active Learning** - learning by **DOING**.  

As you design your lessons, consider what your students are *doing*.  Sitting and listening? Discussing with peers? Reading and writing?

What other ways can learners engage with the course content and with each other?

!!! - Interview an expert
!!! - Create a representation of a concept
!!! - Draw a mind map
!!! - Engage in a role play or case study
!!! - Think-Pair-Share - and any number of pair/group discussion Activities
!!! - Multi-media presentation (video, podcast, image gallery)


Active learning is connected to other key models of learning, such as experiential learning, inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, constructivist learning and collaborative learning. These approaches all focus on students learning through ***doing*** and ***reflecting*** on the process.

One guiding model of **Experiential Learning** was developed in the 70's by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.

### Active Learning & Ed Tech
Sometimes it seems like new ed tech apps pop up every day!  Which are the most effective?  What would help your students actively engage in your course and have a deeper understanding of your course outcomes?

Take a look at the following videos in which our Instructional Designers, Mel and Karen, explain how to use the following apps:
- PowerPoint (or Google Slides)
- Zoom and OneNote
- Jamboard
- Flipgrip
- H5P
- Mentimeter
- Padlet

As you watch, consider how a tech tool might facilitate active learning and critical reflection of your course content.
