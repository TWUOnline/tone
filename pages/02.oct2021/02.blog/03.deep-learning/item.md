> "The student will be able to understand the concepts in this course."

As instructional designers, we often have discussions with instructors about their course learning outcomes.  We try to tease of the meaning of the course by asking, "What are the Big Ideas and Essential Questions you want students to know and ask?  We also want to ensure course learning outcomes are SMART.

![](SMART-goals.png)

For example, students understanding "the concepts in this course" is certainly not specific enough, so it helps to think of major course topics.

Another red flag for instructional designers is the term ***understand***.  It is the go-to verb when writing outcomes, but it is often not specific enough.  To what extent do you want students to understand the material?  Perhaps a surface understanding is appropriate, in which case ***define, describe, compare*** makes more sense.

Or, you may want students to demonstrate critical thinking skills and attain a deeper understanding of the material.  ***Apply, evaluate, infer, create*** - these verbs suggest a deeper understanding is required to meet the learning outcome.

### What is Deeper Learning?
Deeper Learning involves higher order thinking skills and learning dispositions, such as reasoning, anaylzing, problem-solving, and teamwork.

Watch the following video for a brief explanation:

Here's another interesting video - also demonstrating using H5P as an interactive tool to promote engagement with the material.

### So how do you promote deep learning in your class?

This is where activities such as Visible Learning routines and Liberating Structures can help.  By guiding students through various problems, cases, questions, students can think critically and engage with the material, with each other, and with the instructor in a meaningful way.

#### Visible Thinking Routines
These three videos explain Project Zero's Visible Thinking Routines and highlight how the routines can facilitate deeper learning.
