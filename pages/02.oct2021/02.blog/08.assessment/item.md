In Unit 1, we discussed ways to reimagine course design and structure in a digital context. The design process also involves continually reflecting on the way that we assess what learners know and can do.

> The Higher Education Academy (2012) states that “assessment shapes what students study, when they study, how much work they do and the approach they take to their learning. Consequently, assessment design is influential in determining the quality and amount of learning achieved by students,” (p.9).

Online education provides a unique opportunity to shift students from a mindset of what information needs to be gleaned to more authentic ways of learning. The latter hinges on a multidisciplinary approach and the integration of large-scale concepts.

### Authentic Assessment

The pandemic has changed the way that we develop and deliver assessment.

> “Many exams have been replaced by coursework tasks or open book examinations. These forms of assessment better represent the ways in which information is synthesised and applied in real life situations. Tasks that represent what graduates are likely to do in the workplace are often called authentic assessment,” (Winstone & Boud, 2020).

Examples of authentic assessment tasks in online learning can include blog posts, podcasts, ePortfolios, client reports, interviews, and learning journals. The aim is to create a range of opportunities that reflect the types of tasks students will come across in the workforce.

Therefore, if we are indeed assessing authentically, we are viewing education from a multidisciplinary approach. Given that the online environment is constantly changing as new tools emerge, digital literacy and netiquette are essential skills that students can develop through authentic assessment.

Let’s consider how we can shift the focus for students from “assessment *of* learning” to "assessment *for* learning" or "assessment *as* learning" (Earl, 2013). Preparation for a summative exam might involve strategically memorizing small bits of knowledge, but ignore the deeper relationships between ideas. To that end, heavy use of multiple-choice or true/false questions can limit the broader scope of connections, ideas, and further interrogation of the subject. Instead, a final assessment could take the form of a digital story or an ePortfolio.

Creating a digital artifact would allow students to demonstrate what they’ve learned about course content, while also reinforcing their digital citizenship skills. It would also provide opportunities for self and peer-reflection, collaboration, and allow students to authentically demonstrate what they can *do* with their learning.

The next topics delve deeper into the importance of assessment, evaluating the types of assessment used, and grading.
