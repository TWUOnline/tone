Before I publish today's post on Visitors and Residents, I want to think with you a little bit about why I like the approach of using a blog to communicate with learners.

First, given the current situation, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to produce even one (let alone 3 or 4 for September, then another 3-4 for January) fully developed online course in time for September 2020. I don't say this to discourage you, but to encourage you that there are methods of teaching online that don't require a full learning design team to pull off successfully.

I am using this blog (external to Moodle, then embedded) to compose my posts and updates this week, but you don't need to do that. A perfectly acceptable alternative might be to use the Moodle forums, or especially the 'Announcements' forum in your course to post your updates. An advantage of the Announcements forum is that it automatically sends a notification to all of your learners that you have posted. It is worth noting, however, that learners cannot respond to the Announcements forum, so you would need to provide an alternate avenue of communication for those replies and questions.

I also think it is valuable to be able to manage the flow of content and activities that learners receive. There are times when it is good to make sure everyone is thinking about the same thing for a few days. Spacing posts out to 2-3 times per week can be used to match the pace of a f2f class where content is released on a natural schedule. This can allow you to create a blueprint and syllabus at the outset, then make tweaks and adjustments as you work through the semester without having to make significant edits to already published materials. Also, if learners know that they can expect updates throughout the week, they may find it easier to stay on track with the work they are doing that particular week. On the other hand, there is also a reasonable argument to be made for having everything ready to go ahead of time and available for learners to truly work asynchronously on their own time and schedule.

One of the benefits of learning online is that it provides flexibility for both learners and faculty.
