### Welcome to TOnE21!

We trust you are finding balance in your work as we are in the thick of Spring 2021 semester. We know that this year has been challenging for many people and for many different reasons, not least of which is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impacts on higher ed.

The intent of this iteration of the TOnE course is to equip you to prepare for Summer and Fall '21, as it appears that 'normal' has changed in higher ed.

Many learned last year that trying to replicate a face-to-face classroom experience in an online environment is challenging. Zoom is not a classroom. Timezones are a thing. Some people (instructors and learners alike) have inadequate internet bandwidth to support video-conferencing.

So for this iteration of the TOnE course, we are going to focus on a primarily asynchronous, low-bandwidth mode of communication supplemented with more casual and unstructured synchronous meetings.

Below this post, you will see what is called a 'feed' which is essentially a subscription to a blog. Each time I publish a post, that post will show up at the top of the feed. Each post will outline some new content and resources for that topic. You will also notice posts from the Library and other faculty at TWU.

Although I am using a blog to keep you all up-to-date, you can do the same thing with a list of emails.

!!!! If you have your own blog and would like to respond to the reflection prompts for this week on your own blog, send me the URL and I will create another feed of participant posts.
