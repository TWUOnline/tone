## Welcome to our TOnE Session: Active and Visible Pedagogy: Strategies for Deeper Learning!

In this 2 hour session, we'll explore some key ideas in designing effective activities and assessments for your course.  We ask faculty to bring a ‘Wow! ‘ and a ‘Wonder?’  from your teaching practice – something that's worked well to engage your learners, and something you wonder about.  Our focus will be on small group activities to give you the chance to explore and question engagement strategies that are meaningful to you.

Please consider joining us on campus or online!
