### Welcome to our TOnE Session: Active and Visible Pedagogy: Strategies for Deeper Learning!

In this two hour session, we explore some key ideas in designing effective activities and assessments for your course.  We ask faculty to bring a ‘Wow! ‘ and a ‘Wonder?’  from your teaching practice – something that's worked well to engage your learners, and something you wonder about.  Our focus is on small group activities to give you the chance to explore and question engagement strategies that are meaningful to you.

! Date: October 28th OR October 29th  9am-11am
! **Campus Location**: Glass Room, Norma Marion Alloway Library  
! **Zoom**: See email invitation for the Zoom link
