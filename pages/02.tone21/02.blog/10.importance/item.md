In our post-modern society, people constantly ask the question, "why?"

:fa-question: Why do I need to eat my vegetables?  
:fa-question: Why don't more people care about climate change?  
:fa-question: Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?  

Like [Dorothy in Oz](https://youtu.be/ubIpoPjBUds), we want to pay attention to the man behind the curtain before making important (and trivial) decisions or jumping on board with new initiatives.

You have likely heard of author and inspirational speaker [Simon Sinek](https://simonsinek.com/). Like the SuperSonics, Starbucks, the Kraken, and our very own Scott Macklin, Sinek first gained popularity in the Puget Sound region of Washington State, after presenting at a TEDx event in 2009. In his talk, titled "[Start With Why](https://youtu.be/u4ZoJKF_VuA)," he outlines The Golden Circle approach to inspiring action in others by clearly articulating your WHY‚Äîyour purpose, cause, or belief:

(The golden circle, 2018)

Sinek asserts knowing your WHY "is the only way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend of innovation and flexibility" (2009, p. 50). As we look at the importance of assessment, it is crucial to take time and reflect on WHY we assess learning. At TWU, our [Core Values](https://www.twu.ca/about/core-values) and [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes) define our WHY as a Christian liberal arts university dedicated to developing godly Christian leaders. As you continue reading, consider connections between the WHY of TWU and your WHY of assessment.

### Assessment requires feedback loops of learning.

Stiggins et al. define the WHY of assessment as "gather[ing] evidence of student learning that will inform instructional decisions in ways that maximize that learning" (2004, p. 14). Notice the authors' emphasis on student learning‚Äîunder this definition, the instructor adapts their teaching in response to feedback from gathered data. This requires the instructor to be flexible in their planning and follow the needs of the students. White agrees with this learner-centric interpretation of assessment. She writes, "With constant engagement in assessment, we can continue to make decisions about our instruction and how to invite even more learning from all students" (2017, p. 17). Not all assessments require a summative (measurable) indicator of proficiency. When new or complex concepts are introduced, students need low-stakes opportunities to practice, make mistakes, receive feedback, and try again.

! Integrating feedback loops into our assessment practices aligns with First Peoples Principles of Learning: "Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place) (FNESC, n.d.).

### Assessment involves subjective interpretation, not just objective measurement.

The learning process is a highly personal and vulnerable journey towards self-discovery. We all experience learning on a continuum where some approach a learning goal with confidence and zeal and others need time and scaffolded support to practice a new skill (White, 2017). As instructors, we should provide multiple learning opportunities by engaging with our students in an ongoing dialogue through formative feedback and inviting their input on assessment criteria, particularly with digital assessments (Bayne et al., 2020). Artifacts of learning serve a wider purpose than solely meeting course learning outcome requirements. Bayne et al. offer several examples of student-nominated criteria for digital assignments (2020, p. 69):

- Production of a deliverable that other members of the community can benefit from and build upon.
- The relationship between technology and content‚Äîdoes method of delivery aid the effectiveness of the argument?
- Visually interesting.
- It should make you smile at least once.

! By inviting student voice into assessment of their learning, we integrate First Peoples Principles of Learning: "Learning requires exploration of one's identity" (FNESC, n.d.).

### Assessment equips students to have a global impact beyond their time as a student at TWU.

One of our TWU Core Values is for students to have a transformational impact on culture. We as instructors have the privilege and opportunity to design our assessments in a way to prepare our students to interact in society with justice, kindness, and humility (Micah 6:8). You may already have robust integrations in your assessments between course learning outcomes and TWU Core Values, or it may seem like an unnatural stretch to connect your course content with whole student development. Consider White's question: "Is our work about building walls and documenting who climbs over them, or making sure all our learners have the tools and supports to get over any wall life places in front of them?" (2017, p. 17). When you think of your current assessment structure, reflect on whether students are jumping through academic hoops of content memorization or if they are *applying* course content in authentic scenarios and becoming equipped to integrate their knowledge on a global scale.

! Designing assessments with a focus on building Godly character and preparing our students to glorify God through fulfilling the Great Commission ties in with First Peoples Principles of Learning: "Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story" and "Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one's own actions" (FNESC, n.d.).

!!! Learning Activity: Aligning Your Assessments  
!!! üß© Using your Course Blueprint from last week, begin the process of aligning your course assessments with a variety of categories:  
!!! - TWU Core Values  
!!! - TWU Student Learning Outcomes  
!!! - Priority Course Learning Outcomes from your specific course  
!!! - First Peoples Principles of Learning  
!!! - Any discipline- or industry-specific guidelines (e.g., [BC College of Nurses & Midwives Professional Standards](https://www.bccnm.ca/Documents/standards_practice/rn/RN_NP_Professional_Standards.pdf); [Professional Standards for BC Educators](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/kindergarten-to-grade-12/teach/teacher-regulation/standards-for-educators/edu_standards.pdf)).  
!!! üìù You may wish to create a table or grid with a list of your assessments and each of the alignment categories.  
!!! ü§î Consider how your existing assessments align with the assessment WHYs discussed in this blog post. What adjustments could you make to better meet the needs of your learners? To invite student voice? To equip your students to have a transformational impact on culture?
