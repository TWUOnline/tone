# Big Ideas

We begin this section with some questions for your to consider:

- What is it about your field or subject matter that fascinates you?
- What passions drive your research?
- What beliefs do you hold as most valuable about your field of study?
- In your experience, what is most important for students to "take away" from their time with you?

Obviously, these are big questions with incredibly abstract answers. They also, however, serve as the driving force behind the big ideas that are inherent to the experiences students will have in your class. The big ideas help shape how student's make connections between the extensive facets of your field of expertise. Additionally, these *big ideas* serve as a connection between the theoretical field of study and the application of the content to the realities of the world in which we exist.

## What are big ideas?

Big ideas are:

> Statements that are central to one’s understanding in an area of learning. A Big Idea is broad and abstract. It contains key concepts that generally are timeless and transferable to other situations. Big ideas are the key concepts, principles, and theories that are used to organize knowledge within an area of learning. A Big Idea is a statement of an idea that is central to an area of learning or across disciplines and that links numerous understandings into a coherent whole. ~ *BC Ministry of Education, (2016)*

In simplest terms, the big ideas represent what students will *understand* upon completion of your course!

The term “big ideas” comes from  *[Understanding By Design](https://www.ascd.org/Publications/Books/Overview/Understanding-by-Design-Expanded-2nd-Edition.aspx)*, which lists five major qualities of big ideas:

1. They provide a focusing conceptual “lens” for any study
2. They provide breadth of meaning by connecting and organizing many facts, skills, and experiences; serving as the linchpin of understanding
3. They point to ideas at the heart of expert understanding of the subject
4. They require “uncoverage” because its meaning or value is rarely obvious to the learner, is counterintuitive or prone to misunderstanding
5. They have great transfer value; applying to many other inquiries and issues over time — “horizontally” (across subjects) and “vertically” (through the years in later courses) in the curriculum and out of school

*(Wiggins and McTighe, 2005, p. 68.)*

Just as the big ideas of your discipline drive your passion and your student's inquiry, they also help direct the choices you make as an instructor. These big ideas serve as the cohesive "glue" that allows students to find meaning and connection between the diverse and complex elements of your area of study. It may be helpful to think of your big ideas as thesis statements that frame and organize your course content for students, with the intention of lending meaning and purpose to "real-world" contexts and applications.

## Big ideas and Course Design

In previous sections of TOnE21, you were introduced to the process of "Backward Design." Big ideas are a central component of Backward Design as the process involves beginning with a Big Idea and working *backwards* to develop learning outcomes, assessments, learning activities, and thematic cohesion of the content pages.

Working through this design process facilitates the integration of the big ideas into the course content. With this focus during the design process, you can be confident that students are working towards "learning" the big ideas as they progress through the course - these big ideas will be used by students to see the connections between what they are learning and how it is applied.  

As an instructor, the challenge of integrating big ideas into your course design is to choose a **few** big ideas - think of these decisions as what you want students to "take-away" from your course upon completion. These choices will serve as a focus for what to prioritize as you design a course. A helpful approach to this stage of course design is to think about choosing big ideas that are most important to you - this is your way (as an Instructor) of establishing learning priorities and avoiding the pitfall of attempting to teach the whole scope of the discipline in one go.

One final point of clarity that is helpful in understanding the concept of big ideas is to differentiate big ideas from Learning Outcomes. Each course (and unit of a course) has a set of Learning Outcomes that outline the knowledge or skills students should acquire by the end of a course (or section of a course); big ideas are the abstract intentions of your course content that add meaning and relevancy to student learning.

If you are still struggling, some examples of a Big Idea have been provided below. They have been hidden so that you have an opportunity to try developing some on your own. Once you have tried some for your own discipline, take a look at an example - take note of how they are structured:

#### History

!!!! Technology leads to profound social, economic, and political changes.

#### Philosophy

!!!! Philosophy provides tools for investigating meaning and fostering understanding of different ways of thinking.

#### Economics

!!!! The implementation of economic theories has profound effects on social and political decision making and movements.

#### Geography

!!!! Natural processes have an impact on the landscape and human settlement.

#### Kinesiology

!!!! Fitness can be maintained or enhanced through participation in a variety of activities at different intensity levels.

#### Mathematics

!!!! Statistical findings gain value through effective communication.

Hopefully these examples can help you begin thinking about your own big ideas.

## TWU's Student Learning Outcomes

If you are struggling to develop big ideas, take comfort in the fact that developing big ideas is a process. Also, it is important to note that big ideas should be seen as flexible conceptions that evolve and transform over time - these are not written in stone.

A helpful starting point is referring to the [Trinity Western Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes) page. An important statement that can help reinforce the notion of big ideas is that:

> Trinity Western prepares students to deal with complexity, diversity, and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world and helping them to develop transferable intellectual and practical skills. ~*TWU Student Learning Outcomes*

This statement captures the essence of a Big Idea - lending relevancy and meaning to student learning. Additionally, TWU has identified that a student's experience at TWU should support their preparation for a life of learning and service by developing experiences that promote:

1. Knowledge and its Application
2. Cognitive Complexity
3. Aesthetic Expression and Interpretation
4. Inter- and Intra-Personal Wellness
5. Spiritual Formation
6. Social Responsibility and Global Engagement
7. Leadership

Take some time to review these Student Learning Outcomes and consider how you are supporting them in your own course(s). If you are struggling to develop some big ideas, this is a helpful starting point for your own design process as it highlights some of the abstract concepts that student's are expected to understand during their studies at TWU.

!!! ### 💡Learning Activity: Reflection
!!! Developing the big ideas for your course can seem overwhelming - they are, however, a foundational element of course design. This Learning Activity is intended to be a personal reflection that helps you begin thinking through the process of developing big ideas for your own course.
!!! To begin, take some time to consider the following question (it may be helpful to write down your response somewhere so you can look back at it in the future):
!!! - What is the "point" of your course? That is, why is the content of your course important to a student? Try to answer this in one or two sentences that are phrased as statements (e.g. "My course is important because...")
!!! In a recent Faculty Professional Learning Seminar, Christina Bieber presented to the Faculty and posed a number of questions - one of which directly ties to the development of big ideas - take a moment to write down your thoughts on her second big question:
!!! - What is my REAL primary objective here? What kind of person do you want your student to be at the end of your class?"
!!! These questions begin the process of really identifying, and articulating, the big ideas of your course.  Once you have some ideas about the primary objective of your course, we can begin expanding our thoughts and start the process of refining our big ideas - the following questions may help guide this process:
!!! - With all of your experience and expertise, identify three or four ideas about your field of study that you wish you knew when you were a student - these could be about academia or about a career in your field.
!!!   - *Upon completion of your course, are you confident that students will have an understanding of these ideas? How do you know?*
!!!   - *How confident are you that student's understand the "point" of your course upon completion?*

While this reflection will not magically help you identify a big idea, it is intended to help you begin the process of developing one (or some).

Developing a big idea is intended to lend purpose and meaning to student learning. A good starting point for thinking about this purpose and meaning is to consider: *what provides you with a sense of purpose and meaning about your own discipline? What lends relevancy to your field of study?* By taking some time to identify these core values, you can develop a sense of how you can design content in a manner that shares these big ideas with your students.

[notice="note"]
This Learning Activity was structured to be a personal reflection or personal journal entry where each person wrote down their thoughts. These thoughts will (and should) evolve to reflect the evolution of your own personal experience and expertise. The big ideas of your course are no different. It may be helpful to keep a journal to document your thoughts so you have something to refer to as you revisit and refine the design of your course in the future.
