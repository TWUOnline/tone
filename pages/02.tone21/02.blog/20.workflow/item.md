Humans are created to be in community with each other. God hardwired us to crave connection ([Genesis 2:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A18&version=ESV); [Ecclesiastes 4:9-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+4%3A9-12&version=ESV)), build each other up ([Proverbs 27:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A17&version=ESV); [Romans 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=ESV); [1 Peter 4:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A10&version=ESV)), and accomplish more together through Him than we ever could on our own ([John 15:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A4-5&version=ESV); [1 Corinthians 12:12-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A18&version=ESV); [Ephesians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A16&version=ESV)). For centuries, we have become accustomed to defining connection in the physical sense, but as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe it became clear we needed to redefine what it means to be community in creative ways using alternative modalities. A [quick Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=creative+ways+to+stay+connected+during+covid&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA931CA931&oq=create+ways+to+stay+connected+during+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i13j0i22i30j0i390l5.3484j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) brings up hundreds of blogs, platforms, apps, guides, and resources for staying connected during COVID-19. As higher education staff and faculty, we must consider ways to intentionally create community and build connections with, for, and amongst our students in both the physical and virtual classroom environments. In this article, we will focus specifically on ways to use technologies for connection.

## The Importance of First Impressions

When considering online course design, subject matter experts and instructors need to be mindful of interactions between three factors: student development, climate, and learning. Ambrose et al. (2010) write:

> We must recognize that students are not only intellectual but also social and emotional beings, and that these dimensions interact within the classroom climate to influence learning and performance. (p. 156)

Notice the authors do not differentiate between physical and virtual classrooms; learning science is applicable across *all* modalities of teaching and learning. In the introductory paragraphs of their book "Small Teaching Online" (gifted to all TWU faculty from Dr. Husbands), Darby and Lang (2019) paint a dire picture of the initial experience many students encounter on their first day of an online course. The authors describe a student wandering through a physical campus trying to find their classroom, entering the wrong door into a room with the lights out and a pile with random desks and chairs, and an abandoned, outdated syllabus halfheartedly sprawled across the teacher's desk for the student to read on their own. Though dramatic, this fictitious scene parallels the very real structure of many online courses, where students are often left to their own devices to figure out course layout, assignment criteria, synchronous scheduling, participation expectations, and ways to connect with the instructor (and fellow students).

To construct a warm, inviting first impression for your online course, consider creating a **course orientation video** to show your students how to navigate through the course and pre-emptively answer any logistical questions they may have. There are many free screencast tools available. TWU has an institution account for [Screencast-o-matic](https://www.notion.so/Technologies-for-Connection-552b7ba2bae14a90a3f764aa1c938359) and you can gain access by emailing [safe-email autolink="true"]twit@twu.ca[/safe-email] (we suggest trying out the free account for a month or so first to make sure you like using the platform). Once you are set up with your screencast platform, walk your students through the course website by showing them where to find the syllabus, key dates, readings, dropboxes, etc. This gives your students the opportunity to get to know you as an instructor and learn how to navigate through the course before it even begins. You may want to consider having a no-stakes "Course Orientation Mastery Quiz" to ensure students watched your video.

## Exercise Your Tech Muscles

Let's face it: learning something new can be challenging and overwhelming at the best of times, let alone in the midst of a global pandemic! This past year, educators across the world were suddenly expected to be nimble and creative while navigating the seemingly insurmountable mountain of hundreds of tech tools, gadgets, platforms, and apps available to use when communicating with students in the virtual learning environment.

There are several benefits of using technology for connection. Miller (2020) highlights the following advantages of using technology to enhance the learning experience:

:fa-check: We can talk face-to-face with experts and other classrooms like ours all over the world with video calls.  
:fa-check: We can share our work widely with authentic audiences through websites and podcasts.  
:fa-check: We can blur the border of the digital world and the real world through augmented reality.  
:fa-check: We can make learning visible, showing what's in our brains, with graphic design tools.  
:fa-check: We can create audio and video with superb production quality. (p. 10)  

However, it is important to avoid the temptation to use technology as a shallow, "sparkly" way to entice students to engage with bland course content. When instructors use technology without a clear purpose, it can detract from learning rather than enhancing it (Miller, 2014 in Darby & Lang, 2019). So how can online instructors spark a balance between using technology intentionally while becoming proficient at using and implementing the available tools?

One place to start is to become familiar with the tools offered at TWU. By investing time and energy into learning how to use TWU supported platforms, such as [Moodle](https://learn.twu.ca/my/) and [Microsoft Office apps](http://portal.office.com) (e.g., OneDrive, Teams, Word, Excel, Stream, Flipgrid, OneNote), you can be confident in knowing your students have secure access through the university and will not need to create additional accounts. You can also connect with the TWU Online Team, who are knowledgable on TWU supported apps and can offer 1:1 or group support.

!!! ### Learning Activity  
!!! ##### Using Discussion Forums  
!!! Many instructors wonder how to use online discussion forums to engage students both synchronously and asynchronously throughout the semester. Moodle has several options to offer students the opportunity to collaborate and discuss course content using forums. [This informative page](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Forum_activity) demonstrates the variety of forum options available to you in Moodle.

## Focus on People First, Task Second

Remember the story of Jesus' visit to Martha and Mary's home ([Luke 10:38-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42&version=ESV))? Martha buzzes around the house busily cleaning and preparing the food yet, Jesus blesses the actions of Mary who takes time to sit at his feet and listen to his teaching. The ESV version says, "Mary was **distracted** with much serving" (Luke 10:40, emphasis added). Many times, I find myself striving *for* God instead of resting *in* Him. The same can apply to teaching in the online learning environment. We can get bogged down in the minutia of ensuring our course is clearly organized with intuitive navigation structure and the mechanics of running simultaneous synchronous, asynchronous, flex, multi-modal, and hybrid learning options for our students. This approach fails to consider the humanness of our students and the need to give time and space for them to grow as critical thinkers in a connected community. What would happen if we flipped the priority to focus on the affective side of student learning?

Former Walt Disney World Executive Vice President Lee Cockerell (2008) talks about the importance of ARE: Appreciation, Recognition, and Encouragement. He writes:

> Together, they make up a cost-free, fully sustainable fuel, one that builds self-confidence and self-esteem, boosts individual and team performance, and keeps an organization [or classroom] running cleanly and smoothly. ARE is more powerful . . . because it **propels human energy and motivation**. (p. 188, emphasis added)

Take a moment to consider ways you currently incorporate ARE into your teaching and ideas for how to integrate these principles in the future. By appreciating, recognizing, and encouraging your students (and inviting them to build each other up in this way), you may find increased engagement and motivation to contribute and take ownership in an increasingly vibrant and dynamic online learning environment.
