There are a wide variety of possible learning environments in both F2F and online contexts. You might be familiar with Ferris Bueller's economics teacher in the 1986 movie *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*.

### Ferris Bueller's Economics teacher

Or, perhaps, you are familiar with this scene from the 1950s, which might be analogous to some teachers who simply throw everything at their learners in a way that is far too fast for their learners to process. Some people also call this method 'drinking from a fire hose'.

### Lucy and Ethel at the Chocolate Factory

### Predicting school in Y2K.

Or, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France predicting what school would look like in the year 2000. Perhaps Cote was only off by about 20 years in his prediction!

### University in 1350

Perhaps you recognize this scene depicting a university lecture in 1350 in Bologna.

I hope it is obvious to you that not all teaching and learning environments are actually conducive to learning or to building a community. Whether a teacher is putting their learners to sleep, or forcing too much content, or trying to rely on a techno-magical solution, there are problems with all of the learning environments shown above.

Here is my bold and provocative statement for this post...

! Face-to-face interaction, whether mediated through the web or not, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development and growth of transformative communities of inquiry.
