### Formative and Summative Assessment

In our courses, we often think first of the **summative assessments** – the final test, unit quiz, essay, etc. that sums of students' knowledge. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their learning of the course and we give them a final grade.

**Formative assessments** involve giving feedback and helping students learn from the assessment. This ‘forms’ students knowledge so they can further show their understanding of a topic. For example, practice quizzes before a final exam, peer reviews of an essay before the final paper, reflective journals, 1 minute papers, muddiest point, etc., There are numerous effective formative activities to help students and instructors assess learning before being graded.

The image below shows the difference between formative and summative assessment and where it fits into the learning process; assessment *of, for,* and *as* Learning is discussed below.

## Assessment *of, for*, and *as* Learning

Understanding assessment is a critical component in supporting student engagement and student success. While many often think of assessment as a final exam, or a "big final project," on which a student's grade is based, sound assessment is (should be) used for much more.

Assessment is an integral component of the teaching/learning process. Assessments are used to not only facilitate student learning, but also to improve instruction by helping to identify the content that students are comprehending, and the areas where students may be struggling. Assessment strategies can take a variety of forms but the end-goal should always be the collection of meaningful data/information that can inform and guide teaching and learning.

Assessment is generally categorized into three different types: Assessment Learning, Assessment *of* Learning, and Assessment *as* Learning.

### Assessment of Learning

Assessment of Learning is used primarily to compare students and report progress. This type of assessment can be thought of as a "snapshot in time" that informs instructors and students how well each student has completed the learning tasks and activities. This assessment strategy provides useful information for reporting student achievement but, ultimately, has little effect on student learning. This is also sometimes referred to as "summative assessment.

### Assessment for Learning

Assessment for Learning is utilized by instructors to gain an understanding of their students' knowledge and skills. This type of assessment is ongoing and allows instructors to monitor students on a day-to-day basis. For the instructor, this type of assessment helps inform and guide teaching practices so that adjustments can be made to better cultivate student success; for students, this type of assessment provides timely, specific feedback so that they can adjust their learning and focus on opportunities for growth. This is also sometimes referred to as "formative assessment."


### Assessment as Learning

One primary goal of education is to support the skills required to be a lifelong learner. Incorporating Assessment as Learning strategies can create the necessary conditions to support the development of metacognitive skills. By incorporating opportunities that encourage students to engage in peer and self-assessment, an instructor can help students learn how to make sense of information, relate it to prior knowledge and use it for new learning. The goal of this strategy is to help students develop a sense of ownership and efficacy when they use instructor, peer and self-assessment feedback to make adjustments, improvements, and changes to what they understand.



|   | Assessment *of* Learning |  Assessment *for* learning | Assessment *as* learning  |
|:---:|---|---|---|
|  **Why?**  |  To certify or inform others of student's proficiency in relation to curriculum learning outcomes. |To enable instructors to determine next steps in advancing student learning.   | To guide, and provide, opportunities for each student to monitor and critically reflect on their learning and identify the next steps |
|**What?**   |  The extent to which student's can apply the key concepts, knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the curriculum outcomes.| Each student's progress, and learning needs, in relation to the curricular outcomes.  | Each student's thinking about their learning such as: what strategies they use to support or challenge their learning; and what mechanisms they use to adjust and advance their learning.  |
| **Methods?**  | A range of methods in different modes that assess both product and process.  | A range of methods in different modes that make students' skills and understanding visible.  |  A range of methods in different modes that that elicit students' learning and metacognitive processes. |
| **Ensuring Quality**   | <br> - Accuracy, consistency, and fairness of judgments based on high-quality information<br> - Clear, detailed learning expectations<br> - Fair and accurate summative reporting |<br> - Accuracy and consistency of observations and interpretations of student learning<br> - Clear, detailed learning expectations<br> - Accurate, detailed notes for descriptive feedback to each student  |<br> - Accuracy and consistency of student’s self-reflection, self-monitoring, and self-adjustment<br> - Engagement of the student in considering, and challenging, their own thinking<br> - Students record their own learning  |
|  **Use of Information** |<br> - Indicate each student’s level of learning<br> - Provide the foundation for discussions on placement or promotion<br> - Report fair, accurate, and detailed information that can be used to decide the next step’s in a student’s learning  |<br> - Provide each student with descriptive feedback to further their learning<br> - Differentiate instruction by continually checking and where each student is in relation to the curricular outcomes  |<br> - Provide each student with accurate, descriptive feedback that will help them develop independent learning habits<br> - Have each student focus on the task and their learning (not on getting the “right” answer)<br> - Provide each student with ideas for adjusting, rethinking, and articulating their learning<br> - Provide the structural conditions for the instructor and student to discuss alternatives<br> - Students report about their learning  |
