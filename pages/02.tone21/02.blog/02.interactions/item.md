### Interacting in TOnE21

We have set up multiple channels for communication during TOnE21, some of which we hope will persist after the course is officially over.

#### Moodle
You may be most familiar with the Moodle discussion forum tool for interactions in an online course, or maybe it is new for you. Either way, we have created a forum for each of the four units of the course as well as a general forum for Q&A. [These forums are available on the 'Interactions' tab in the Moodle site](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=17949&section=2), and you are encouraged to use those forums to respond to the suggested learning activities in each post. The 'Enrol key' is `tone21`.

During each 2-week unit, and spread out during the unit, course contributors (listed on the Overview page), will publish a blog post about one topic in the unit we are engaging with. Each unit will contain 4-5 posts, each from a different author. [You will be able to access those posts in Moodle, on the 'Interactions' tab](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=17949&section=2) under the heading 'Course Feed'.

Also within Moodle, we have added an 'External tool' connection to a MS OneNote binder. This is available for you to organize learning pods and for your learning pod to use as a collaborative workspace. We are very interested in how you use this space.

#### The course website

This course is published at [multi-access.tuw.ca/tone/tone21](https://multi-access.tuw.ca/tone/tone21), and the content you see in Moodle is an embedded view of the content on the course website. [You can find the course blog under the menu item 'Course Updates'](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21/blog).

If you would like to be updated on posts as they are published, you may want to use a feed reader like [Feedly](https://feedly.com) or [Inoreader](https://inoreader.com) to subscribe to the course feed, which is `https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21.rss`.

#### The connected network of your sites
The web is profoundly powerful for a number of reasons, including the humble hyperlink, and a protocol known by its acronym, RSS. TWU hosts a WordPress installation for anyone in the community who would like to register for a site of their own. You may be interested in using this site at [create.twu.ca](https://create.twu.ca) to start a blog to record your responses and reflections related to TOnE21. If you choose to do this, please let us know, and we will add the feed from your site (it's alreay set up by default) to a feed of participant responses accessible in Moodle or in a feed reader.

Choosing this option will allow you to build a rich network of connected blogs that reference each other and can then grow and develop beyond the course. Please email elearning at twu dot ca if you need assistance.

#### Hypothes.is

As you may have heard, TWU is part of a pilot project using the tool [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), a tool used to annotate documents and publications available on the web. The pilot includes access to hypothes.is directly within Moodle and connected to the course list and gradebook. We will publish a post with instructions for how to use hypothes.is.

#### Synchronous meetings

Every other Friday, beginning February 12, at 11:00 AM Pacific time, we will meet in Zoom (link is published in Moodle), for a time of collegial reflection and support. This will not be used as a time to broadcast content, but a time to engage in conversation about what we are learning. We hope you will join us.

Also, on the opposite Fridays at 11:00 AM at the same Zoom link, we meet for the TOnE Swap Meets for a more informal time of sharing strategies, tools, and resources in a collegial and supportive environment.

#### Learning Pods
We will facilitate the formation of small learning pods of 2-4 people who will meet on their own schedule and time to discuss the course and provide support for each other.

### An invitation...
You are invited, but certainly not obligated, to participate in the manner that makes sense for you, your workload, and your personal context. If you try to engage fully with all of the activities and channels available to you, you will likely run out of time, so please be conscious of your needs and bandwidth.

We look forward to the next several weeks!
