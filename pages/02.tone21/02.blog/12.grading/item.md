!!!! Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts. - Albert Einstein

It is interesting to note that outside of education, the practice of grading is used in the industrial setting to quickly mark whether a product, like shoes or tools or beef, has met the standards to be sold.  From this perspective, it seems jarring to simply sum up a student's learning (which is much more dynamic and complicated than constructing a pair of shoes) into one mark, and yet, [as discussed in the Measurement blog post](https://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/tone21/blog/measurement), this is a normal practice. Confounding this, is that often students are left to interpret what this one mark means, and often can do nothing with it. There is growing popularity to get rid of grades altogether, and these voices are quick to reason that grades do not provide adequate feedback or encourage student growth (Blum, 2017;  Kohn, 1994). Thomas Guskey summarizes the research on grading in his article, *Grades versus comments: Research on student feedback,* and points out that

> We know that while grades certainly have their limitations, they are not inherently good or bad. They are simply labels attached to different levels of student performance that describe in an abbreviated fashion how well students performed. These labels can be letters, numbers, words, phrases, or symbols. They can serve important formative purposes by helping students know where they are on the path to achieving specific learning goals.

> We also know that grades should always be based on clearly articulated learning criteria; not norm-based criteria. Grades derived from norm-based criteria — that is, ego-involving indicators of students’ relative standing among classmates — communicate nothing about what students have learned or are able to do.(Guskey, 2019)

[details="More on normal distributions..."]
It seems likely that you are familiar with a 'normal distribution', where the mean of a set is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

Some have been tempted to aim for a normal distribution of grades in their courses, but this temptation is misguided because a normal distribution represents a ***random sample*** of a given population. Learners in our courses who have completed some learning activities related to the course content are not a random sample of the population. Consequently, the distribution of grades in courses should be negatively skewed (long tail to the left).

The symbol to represent a student's learning isn't the problem with grading, but how and what we grade is. Grading that moves away from ranking and sorting students (ego-involving, norm-based) and towards individualized feedback based on criteria can increase student learning (Kohn, 1994). These comments can be any communication directly related to student work, and it can address their learning gaps, or their opportunities to grow, and celebrates their successes.  Grading for the purpose of providing quality feedback to deepen student understanding shifts learning from a transactional model (I do this work to get a good grade) to an interactional and transformative model (we do this to grow).  This type of grading (or learning) also helps students

> understand that grades do not reflect who you are as a learner, but where you are in your learning journey — ***and where is always temporary.*** Knowing where you are is essential to understanding where you need to go in order to improve (Guskey, 2019, para. 20, emphasis added).  

In other words, students can *do* something with quality feedback.  

The alternatives to the historical grading system are not as difficult or more labor intensive as some might imagine, but it does require instructors to focus on what competencies they want their students to acquire, defining what success looks and sounds likes, and then assessing evidence of student learning with that qualitative criteria.  There are different ways to approach this and Townsley and Schmid (2020) share three options:

1. Mastery-based grading
2. Standards-based grading
3. Specifications grading

One of the strengths of these methods is that it gives grades more meaning because the learning targets are explicitly communicated and assessed.  It also separates behaviours from academic understanding, so grades are not obscured by work habits or other non-academic behaviours (Townsley, 2019).  Students have a better sense of "how am I doing in this class?" when they look at their mark.  Because feedback is integral to each of these grading systems, instructors can address behaviours in a timely manner and there are multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding. Overall, these grading systems are designed to help students learn and progress competently in their learning journey.

!!! ### **Learning Activity: Dive In, Dig Deeper**
!!! Take a look at Townsley & Schmid's (2020) article [Alternative grading practices: An entry point for faculty in competency‐based education](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbe2.1219) summarizing alternatives to traditional grading practices and reflect on the following questions:
!!! 1. How is grading based on competencies different than traditional grading practices?
!!! 2. What are elements of competency-based grading that interest you?  What are elements that worry you?
!!! 3. What can we do with our current grading practices so that they better reflect transformative learning and promote enduring understandings?
