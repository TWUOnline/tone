Now that we have clarified some of the language associated with online learning, and have a better understanding of the modalities associated with it, we now shift our attention to course structure. Designing a course in an online environment requires a shift in traditional "classroom" thinking. In an online learning environment, the goal is to create a positive, learner-centered experience. This requires careful consideration of how you are going to "structure" the design of your course.

One approach that can help with the development of your course is called the Flipped Classroom Approach outlined below.                                            

## The Flipped Classroom Approach

The Flipped Classroom involves a “flip” or a change in learning culture. In the traditional teacher-centered approach, the teacher is the main source of information. By contrast, the Flipped Learning model purposefully shifts instruction to a student-centered approach. Core concepts are first encountered independently, while class time focuses on higher level cognitive activities and clarifying misconceptions.

In an online environment, students study material asynchronously, and then apply these concepts through problem-solving and group activities during online workshops.

The “flipped” approach therefore encourages inquiry-based and cooperative learning, while simultaneously allowing students to explore concepts in greater depth. From the instructor’s perspective, this approach can provide opportunities to address students’ misconceptions and act as an immediate feedback tool.

## Developing Asynchronous Material

In an online flipped classroom, the majority of course content is available to students *before* the synchronous class time. Remote learning has altered the traditional classroom dynamic and impacted how we teach. As many students are already studying material asynchronously, we have the opportunity utilize the flipped classroom approach.

To begin, the focus should be on intentional content. Consider how you want your course content to “look” in this medium. What information do students need to learn before class in order to actively participate in group activities later? Scaffolding is common, particularly if there is a sizable amount of content. Using a combination of text and mini-lectures is another method of breaking up content into smaller chunks that learners can readily grasp. In the “flipped” approach, students are responsible for their own learning. Revising the pedagogy to fit the online modality **also means that students have flexibility and autonomy regarding how much time they devote to the instructor’s asynchronous content.** Therefore, a combination of scaffolding and **purposively segmented** text and video recordings can encourage continuous study of material.

You might also consider using an inductive reasoning approach. Present scenarios, key words, or examples of the concept first, and allow students to make generalizations and inferences. One benefit of inductive learning is that it promotes analytical thinking, as students have to determine which information is and is not relevant.

### Challenges

One of the primary challenges associated with developing resources for the flipped classroom is that it requires significant preparation and can be time-consuming.

Utilizing material already available on YouTube and using Open Educational Resources can mitigate prep time. Resources from the Khan Academy, TED Talks (see the "Flip this Lesson" feature from TED-Ed), and using written prompts where students can “pause” to reflect on their learning will help students grasp important material. As students will be studying this material independently, the key is finding and creating content that has a stepwise progression.

## Developing Workshop Activities

John Biggs (2012) discusses the challenges associated with aligning teaching methods with cognitive objectives. He states that

> tertiary objectives require students to use knowledge, [however] much tertiary teaching is not about using knowledge but telling students about using knowledge. Such declarative knowledge…does not necessarily imply that it can be used functionally (p. 48).

Class time in the “flipped” approach encourages student accountability and enhances self-efficacy. It provides a “training area” of sorts, where students can practice and apply concepts, make mistakes, and ask questions.

In an online format, repurposing class time into workshops can create rich learning opportunities. Workshops can involve interaction through learning pods (assessment “of” and “as” learning), collaboration through whiteboards, and larger synchronous group discussions. Using the Jigsaw Method (where each student is assigned a topic to “teach” their peers), [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) or [Nearpod](https://nearpod.com/international?utm_expid=.ZVArKVVVQnSoco-KQvCRUw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) (polling and collaborative boards), or [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/) (gamified quizzes) can act as informal “checks” on whether students have read the material.

Since these workshops rely heavily on student participation, you are encouraged to develop activities which allow learners to draw from authentic experience. In this manner, information becomes more personalized, meaningful, and more likely content that students will remember.
