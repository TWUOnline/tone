Finally, we arrive at the final component of course design. Each section of this unit has added a sequential layer of detail that requires consideration as you go about the development of your course - structural decisions will guide design decisions which will, ultimately, influence how you go about planning out the course (the blueprint!).

The final *layer* we need to add helps bring the content to life. It is important to think about how the content in each section of a course is sequenced as the focus should be on creating an intuitive experience for learners. A student should be focused on learning - not expending energy on trying to figure out how the pieces of content "fit" together. To achieve this, it is helpful to utilize a design technique called storyboarding.

### Storyboarding

You may or may not be familiar with the idea of a storyboard, but, assuming you’ve seen a movie or watched a cartoon made after the 1930’s, you’ve seen the fruit of this important planning tool. Storyboarding is a critical step in the pre-production process (the planning stage) of filmmaking.

A storyboard is a tool. It’s a shot by shot graphical representation of a story intended to be produced as a film or animation. Storyboards are usually created once the script has been finalized but before production begins. A storyboard panel is drawn from the perspective of the camera, and is used to convey composition within a shot. Arrows might be added to show movement of the camera or characters and notes supplement the panel image when necessary.

Around the 1930’s, animator Webb Smith, working at Walt Disney Studios, began roughly sketching out shot by shot breakdowns for the short animations the studio produced. These early storyboards were used by the team of animators to pre-visualize their productions and work out any potential problems before real illustration began. This gave the animators greater opportunity for collaboration and experimentation with character design and character expression. Story pace, and camera movement were also worked out at this stage. The storyboarding process improved the overall quality of production and helped with budgeting. Shortly after Disney recognized the value of the pre-visualizing animation, other studios did too.

Today, storyboarding is common practice throughout the film industry. Major studios have a dedicated department of storyboard artists who collaborate with writers, directors and cinematographers to pre-visualize the big budget productions they work on.

Other industries such as marketing, writing, web and software development have adopted storyboarding in one form or another. Having illustrated panels that can be easily reordered and adapted allows problems to be reimagined. Ultimately storyboarding is a tool to convey meaning, to experiment and to see ideas with fresh perspective.

### Final Thoughts

In addition to developing intuitive content, the role of the instructor also includes bringing the content to "life." An important detail of course design is ensuring a course has a "voice" - the focus here is on adding a human feel to the course...especially in an online environment. While there is no simple solution for this part of the design process, developing an awareness of the language you use and the tone that language conveys is important to consider - it also helps to know and understand who your learners are going to be. Another helpful suggestion is to consider adding examples of practical applications of the content to make it more meaningful for learners.

Ultimately the goal is to ensure that the "story" of our content is easy to follow, engaging and relevant to learners in our class.
